MARINE CORPS

  


The U.S. Marine Corps falls under the Department of the Navy; however its command structure is similar to the Army’s, except it follows the “rule of three” and includes Marine expeditionary forces and aircraft wings. The Marines are divided into four groups: the operating forces that do the actual fighting, the headquarters for leadership, the supporting establishment that provides logistical support, and the Marine Corps Reserve.

Command Structure


Basic Units

Expeditionary Forces

Aircraft Units

While the Marine Corps falls under the Department of the Navy, its command structure is similar to the Army’s, with teams, squadrons, platoons and battalions, except it follows the “rule of three,” meaning there are usually three of each lower unit within the next larger unit.
VIEW MARINE UNITS


The Marine Corps’ principal warfighting organization during large crises is the Marine expeditionary force. The Corps has three MEFs, and each is made up of ground, air and logistics forces. They act as standing Marine air-ground task forces in peacetime and war. MEFs are capable of projecting power on land or at sea and are able to support themselves in combat for up to 60 days.
VIEW EXPEDITIONARY FORCES


Another exception to the basic unit structure is Marine aviation, which is broken down into commands made of squadrons, groups and wings. The squadron is the basic tactical and administrative unit. One or more squadrons form a group, and one or more groups form a wing.

Marine aviation squadrons are about the size equivalent of a battalion and are organized by aircraft type – fixed-wing aircraft, tiltrotor aircraft and helicopters - although there are nonflying squadrons, too, such as those for logistics. Squadrons are expected to execute a list of specified mission-essential tasks. For example, Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121 is based at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan, as the first forward-deployed permanent F-35B Lightning II squadron.






GroupsAircraft Units



groups



Equivalent to a regiment


Made up of

3squadrons





Three or more squadrons form a group, which is equivalent in size to a regiment. There are several kinds of groups: aircraft, air control, training support and wing support. Aircraft groups are made up of the aircraft themselves and the people who support them to fly; air control groups coordinate all aspects of air command and air defense. Support groups provide administrative duties, ceremonial support and special-detail advisors.






WingsAircraft Units

Brief History of the United States Marine Corps

 
On November 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia passed a resolution stating that ""two Battalions of Marines be raised"" for service as landing forces with the fleet. This resolution established the Continental Marines and marked the birth date of the United States Marine Corps. Serving on land and at sea, these first Marines distinguished themselves in a number of important operations, including their first amphibious raid into the Bahamas in March 1776, under the command of Captain (later Major) Samuel Nicholas. The first commissioned officer in the Continental Marines, Nicholas remained the senior Marine officer throughout the American Revolution and is considered to be the first Marine Commandant. The Treaty of Paris in April 1783 brought an end to the Revolutionary War and as the last of the Navy's ships were sold, the Continental Navy and Marines went out of existence.
Following the Revolutionary War and the formal re-establishment of the Marine Corps on 11 July 1798, Marines saw action in the quasi-war with France, landed in Santo Domingo, and took part in many operations against the Barbary pirates along the ""Shores of Tripoli"".
Marines took part in numerous naval operations during the War of 1812, as well as participating in the defense of Washington at Bladensburg, Maryland, and fought alongside Andrew Jackson in the defeat of the British at New Orleans.
The decades following the War of 1812 saw the Marines protecting American interests around the world, in the Caribbean, at the Falkland Islands, Sumatra and off the coast of West Africa, and also close to home in operations against the Seminole Indians in Florida.
During the Mexican War (1846-1848), Marines seized enemy seaports on both the Gulf and Pacific coasts. A battalion of Marines joined General Winfield Scott's army at Pueblo and fought all the way to the ""Halls of Montezuma,"" Mexico City. Marines also served ashore and afloat in the Civil War (1861-1865). Although most service was with the Navy, a battalion fought at Bull Run and other units saw action with the blockading squadrons and at Cape Hatteras, New Orleans, Charleston, and Fort Fisher. The last third of the 19th century saw Marines making numerous landings throughout the world, especially in the Orient and in the Caribbean area.

Following the Spanish-American War (1898), in which Marines performed with valor in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, the Corps entered an era of expansion and professional development.
It saw active service in the Philippine Insurrection (1899-1902), the Boxer Rebellion in China (1900). and in numerous other nations, including Nicaragua, Panama, Cuba, Mexico, and Haiti.
 
 
 
 
In World War I the Marine Corps distinguished itself on the battlefields of France as the 4th Marine Brigade earned the title of ""Devil Dogs"" for heroic action during 1918 at Belleau Wood, Soissons, St. Michiel, Blanc Mont, and in the final Meuse-Argonne offensive.

 
Marine aviation, which dates from 1912, also played a part in the war effort, as Marine pilots flew day bomber missions over France and Belgium. More than 30,000 Marines served in France and more than a third were killed or wounded in six months of intense fighting.
During the two decades before World War II, the Marine Corps began to develop in earnest the doctrine, equipment, and organization needed for amphibious warfare. The success of this effort was proven first on Guadalcanal, then on Bougainville, Tarawa, New Britain, Kwajalein, Eniwetok, Saipan, Guam, Tinian, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. By the end of the war in 1945, the Marine Corps had grown to include six divisions, five air wings, and supporting troops. Its strength in World War II peaked at 485,113. The war cost the Marines nearly 87,000 dead and wounded, and 82 Marines had earned the Medal of Honor.
While Marine units took part in the post-war occupation of Japan and North China, studies were undertaken at Quantico, Virginia, which concentrated on attaining a ""vertical envelopment"" capability for the Corps through the use of helicopters.
 
Landing at Inchon, Korea in September 1950, Marines proved that the doctrine of amphibious assault was still viable and necessary. After the recapture of Seoul, the Marines advanced to the Chosin Reservoir only to see the Chinese Communists enter the war. After years of offensives, counter-offensives, seemingly endless trench warfare, and occupation duty, the last Marine ground troops were withdrawn in March 1955. More than 25,000 Marines were killed or wounded during the Korean War.
In July 1958, a brigade-size force landed in Lebanon to restore order. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, a large amphibious force was marshaled but not landed. In April 1965, a brigade of Marines landed in the Dominican Republic to protect Americans and evacuate those who wished to leave.
The landing of the 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade at Da Nang in 1965 marked the beginning of large-scale Marine involvement in Vietnam. By summer 1968, after the enemy's Tet Offensive, Marine Corps strength in Vietnam rose to a peak of approximately 85,000. The Marine withdrawal began in 1969 as the South Vietnamese began to assume a larger role in the fighting; the last Marine ground forces were out of Vietnam by June 1971.
The Vietnam War, longest in the history of the Marine Corps, exacted a high cost as well with over 13,000 Marines killed and more than 88,000 wounded. In the spring of 1975, Marines evacuated embassy staffs, American citizens, and refugees in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Saigon, Republic of Vietnam. In May, Marines played an integral role in the rescue of the crew of the SS Mayaguezcaptured off the coast of Cambodia.
The mid-1970s saw the Marine Corps assume an increasingly significant role in defending NATO's northern flank as amphibious units of the 2d Marine Division participated in exercises throughout northern Europe. The Marine Corps also played a key role in the development of the Rapid Deployment Force, a multi-service organization created to insure a flexible, timely military response around the world when needed. The Maritime Prepositioning Ships (MPS) concept was developed to enhance this capability by prestaging equipment needed for combat in the vicinity of the designated area of operations, and reduce response time as Marines travel by air to link up with MPS assets.
The 1980s brought an increasing number of terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies around the world. Marine Security Guards, under the direction of the State Department, continued to serve with distinction in the face of this challenge. In August 1982, Marine units landed at Beirut, Lebanon, as part of the multi-national peace-keeping force. For the next 19 months these units faced the hazards of their mission with courage and professionalism. In October 1983, Marines took part in the highly successful, short-notice intervention in Grenada. As the decade of the 1980s came to a close, Marines were summoned to respond to instability in Central America. Operation Just Cause was launched in Panama in December 1989 to protect American lives and restore the democratic process in that nation.
Less than a year later, in August 1990, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait set in motion events that would lead to the largest movement of Marine Corps forces since World War II. Between August 1990 and January 1991, some 24 infantry battalions, 40 squadrons, and more than 92,000 Marines deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Desert Shield. Operation Desert Storm was launched 16 January 1991, the day the air campaign began.
The main attack came overland beginning 24 February when the 1st and 2d Marine Divisions breached the Iraqi defense lines and stormed into occupied Kuwait. By the morning of February 28, 100 hours after the ground war began, almost the entire Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti theater of operations had been encircled, with 4,000 tanks destroyed and 42 divisions destroyed or rendered ineffective.
Overshadowed by the events in the Persian Gulf during 1990-91, were a number of other significant Marine deployments demonstrating the Corps' flexible and rapid response. Included among these were non-combatant evacuation operations in Liberia and Somalia and humanitarian lifesaving operations in Bangladesh, the Philippines, and northern Iraq.
In December 1992, Marines landed in Somalia marking the beginning of a two-year humanitarian relief operation in that famine-stricken and strife-torn nation. In another part of the world, Marine Corps aircraft supported Operation Deny Flight in the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina. During April 1994, Marines once again demonstrated their ability to protect American citizens in remote parts of the world when a Marine task force evacuated U.S. citizens from Rwanda in response to civil unrest in that country.
Closer to home, Marines went ashore in September 1994 in Haiti as part of the U.S. force participating in the restoration of democracy in that country. During this same period Marines were actively engaged in providing assistance to the Nation's counter-drug effort, assisting in battling wild fires in the western United States, and aiding in flood and hurricane relief operations.
The Marine Corps continued its tradition of innovation to meet the challenges of a new century. The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory was created in 1995 to evaluate change, assess the impact of new technologies on warfighting, and expedite the introduction of new capabilities into the operating forces of the Marine Corps. Exercises such as “Hunter Warrior,” and “Urban Warrior” were designed to explore future tactical concepts, and to examine facets of military operations in urban environments.
During the late 1990's, Marine Corps units deployed to several African nations, including Liberia, the Central African Republic, Zaire, and Eritrea, in order to provide security and assist in the evacuation of American citizens during periods of political and civil instability in those nations.
Humanitarian and disaster relief operations were also conducted by Marines during 1998 in Kenya, and in the Central American nations of Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In 1999, Marine units deployed to Kosovo in support of Operation Allied Force. Soon after the September 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C., Marine units deployed to the Arabian Sea and in November set up a forward operating base in southern Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.
In 2002, the Marine Corps continued to play a key role in the Global War on Terrorism. Marines operated in diverse locations, from Afghanistan, to the Arabian Gulf, to the Horn of Africa and the Philippines. Early 2003 saw the largest deployment of Marine forces since the Persian Gulf War of 1990-91 when 76,000 Marines deployed to the Central Command area for combat operations against Iraq.
 
 
The I Marine Expeditionary Force, including Task Force Tarawa and the United Kingdom’s 1st Armored Division, were the first conventional ground units to enter Iraq in late March as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Fixed-wing and helicopter aircraft from the 3d Marine Air Wing provided continuous close air and assault support to Marine and coalition units as they drove deeper into Iraq. On the ground, Marines from I MEF moved nearly 400 miles from the Kuwait border to Baghdad and Tikrit, Iraq, and eliminated the last organized resistance by Iraqi military forces. Although I MEF would transition to stabilization and security operations and then redeploy to the U.S. by late September, I MEF began preparing for a return to Iraq in early 2004.
The adaptability and reliability of Marine forces continued to be highlighted around the world from the Horn of Africa to Haiti and to the Philippines.
 
 
Across the U.S., Marine units from both coasts fought and contained wildfires, and also supported hurricane relief efforts in various parts of the country. In December, 2004, a tsunami struck numerous nations in the Indian Ocean region killing more than 150,000 and causing enormous devastation. Marine units from III MEF were immediately deployed to Thailand, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka to assist in disaster relief operations.
In early 2005, the II Marine Expeditionary Force replaced I MEF in Iraq as the primary focus began to shift to partnership operations with the Iraqi Security Forces. Marine units continued to provide air and ground support to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Closer to home, the flexibility and responsiveness of the Navy/Marine team was exhibited during September and October when nearly 3000 Marines and sailors conducted search and rescue, humanitarian relief, and disaster recovery operations in Louisiana and Mississippi in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Today's Marine Corps stands ready to continue in the proud tradition of those who so valiantly fought and died at Belleau Wood, Iwo Jima, the Chosin Reservoir, and Khe Sanh. Combining a long and proud heritage of faithful service to the nation, with the resolve to face tomorrow's challenges will continue to keep the Marine Corps the ""best of the best.""

Targets! Marine Corps Base Camp Blaz Installs Range Targets 

                    Despite Typhoon Mawar’s destruction across the island, the ongoing enhancements at the Mason Live Fire Training Range Complex are in full swing. Throughout May to July, Marine Corps Base Camp Blaz is installing static and moving targets on two of its four ranges at the Mason range complex. As their names suggest, automated, moving targets test the shooter’s ability to lead and hit a target moving at different speeds, and static targets hone the basic, essential elements of marksmanship. Using static and automated targets provide better marksmanship feedback to the shooter...

                    “Any father would be proud, no matter what profession, if his son decided to follow in his footsteps,” said U.S. Marine Corps Master Sgt. Christopher Lisle, the Expeditionary Firefighting & Rescue Chief with Marine Aircraft Control Group-28. “To share the title of Marine and to share that bond is something that we don’t really speak about, but we have become closer and share more than what we used to.” Lisle, a native of Lakeland, Florida, joined the Marine Corps in May 1999 to get out of his town and to get away from dead-end jobs. He wanted to do something more with his life and see the world, and the Marine Corps provided just that.

Welcome Back Lunga Park, We Missed You! 

                    Morale has been an important part of the Marine Corps since its founding and as all good leaders will attest, it’s also a key to the success of Marines and their families wherever they serve. Morale comes in different shapes and sizes. It may look like campfires, boats, fishing, cabins and maybe even a lake or, in the case of Quantico, a reservoir. For decades, Lunga Recreation area and Reservoir was a favorite location for locals to relax, fish, camp, host command events, and even celebrate holidays like the fourth of July. In February 2012, after partially exposed mortar fins were found in the recreational area, Lunga was temporarily closed while Naval Facilities Engineering Command, and the Marine Corps explosives safety authority conducted an area survey to determine if the park was safe for continued use...

Food for Thought: What to Know About Cooking with Alcohol
What is the secret ingredient that makes your favorite dish so flavorful? For some it is a special seasoning. For others it might be alcohol. Many believe cooking with alcohol provides benefits such as improved flavors and tenderness in dishes. Due to alcohol’s chemical make-up, alcohol quickly connects the aroma of food to the smell receptors in your nose. Cooking with alcohol enhances the aromas associated with the food as it cooks, as well as the flavor while you’re actually eating it. Your sense of taste and smell work together to enrich your perception of the food’s flavor.

Tobacco and Stress: Not a Winning Combination
Most people understand that tobacco harms a person’s health, but many users also believe it helps them cope with stress. Nicotine is a mood altering drug, so at first tobacco may seems to help ease the effects of stress such as feelings of frustration, anger, or anxiety. This is because the nicotine in tobacco causes the brain to release a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine results in an initial sense of calm and well-being and causes your body to crave that sensation again and again. Really, this is just an illusion; while a person may feel an initial sense of calm when they use tobacco, the body is actually under increased stress. Blood pressure and heart rate increase, muscles become tense, and blood vessels constrict so less oxygen is available to the brain and body to facilitate healthy coping. The initial feelings of stress are still present, but simply masked.

The President's Own: Established in 1798 to provide music for the President of the United States and the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Their calendar includes chamber and symphony performances, live concerts, and VIP events such as state dinners. 


CALENDAR


U.S. Marine Drum and Bugle Corps: Officially established in 1956 and is located at the oldest post of the Corps. Experience the excitement of the premier musical marching unit throughout the summer at the Tuesday and Friday night parades located in Washington, D.C.


PARADE INFORMATION


Marine Corps Bands: Trained combat warriors, who have marched with commands since the inception of the Corps. They support military ceremonies, official activities and provide security in times of war. From local ceremonies to live community performances, find a field band performance near you.

testimonials
""The MCEF exceeded my expectations, and I had high expectations going into the day. As I reflect on what had the greatest impact on me, I cannot shake the unmistakable bond all of the Marines had. Clearly the Corps attracts, trains, retains and otherwise produces high achievers. I look forward to recruiting a few of your colleagues!”
- MCEF Participant
 
“I was very impressed with every Marine I came across. Marines are articulate, leaders, fit, squared-away, respectful, well mannered, demonstrate advanced knowledge in their area of operation, and all around well-rounded. Marines truly are special. I'm now an empowered and educated ambassador for the Marines. After this experience, I will tell every business owner/H.R. person: Hire a Marine.  I think you can train a Marine to do just about any job you have. They are leaders, very hard working, polite and doers.""

Marine Corps Speakers
Every Marine has a story to tell, and the Corps supports them doing so at community events across the country, from small-town civic organizations to big-city national conventions.
Every Marine has a story to tell, and nothing brings Americans closer nor lends more understanding, than sharing those experiences. Americans can hear what it’s like to be a Marine and what leads young men and women to serve their nation. What is it like serving in Iraq or Afghanistan? What prompts someone to become a Marine?

Sponsor Requirements

Collapse All Expand All
  SPONSOR RESPONSIBILITIES
When a request is made by an organization for Marine Corps assets, you as the event organizer are designated as the “sponsor” on the DD-2536. Please understand that events are covered based on availability of the unit to participate and will only be authorized when such support does not interfere with mission or training programs. In all cases, operational commitments take priority and can cause previously scheduled appearances to be cancelled. It is the sponsor’s responsibility to coordinate and keep a dialogue with the unit to ensure that circumstances don’t change and the unit is still able to attend the event in the days prior to your event.
Department of Defense policies require that Armed Forces participation in public events will be provided at no additional cost to the Government. The sponsor is required to pay, when necessary, the standard Military Services allowance for quarters and meals for all Armed Forces participants and for other services which have been determined in advance by the Military Services and agreed to by the sponsor. Transportation and meal costs are not usually incurred when support is provided from a local military installation. However, circumstances may dictate that reimbursement for any or all of these costs may be necessary. All costs are binding after a unit, personnel, or exhibit has arrived at an event site even though weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances may force the event to be cancelled. Please note, Armed Forces musical units are organized for ceremonial and traditional purposes and to support recruiting activities. However, they may be authorized to provide certain specified presentations (such as patriotic ceremonies) for public programs.  Armed Forces musical organizations are not permitted to provide entertainment, background, dinner, dance, or other social music at public or private events in competition with the customary or regular employment of local civilian musicians.
 

  INTERNATIONAL REQUEST INFORMATION
For all international Marine Corps asset requests, please contact the Public Affairs office of the Unified Combatant Command in the respective area where the event will take place.
Those requests shall be forwarded through command channels to the ASD(PA) for approval. Approval shall be based upon program, sponsor, site, support criteria, and upon any recommendations or requests for an exception to a policy offered by applicable commanders.

  REQUEST SUPPORT
Please complete the information requested in the DD-2536 completely, as incomplete requests will not be processed.  Submit your request 30-90 days in advance in order to ensure the minimum amount of planning and coordination by the supporting unit to support your event. Submit your request form to a Marine Corps installation within 60 miles of your event location (see band locator map). If you are not within 60 miles of the Marine Corps installation, please submit your request to Marine Forces Reserve Community Relations at mfrcomrel@usmc.mil. Do not fax your request. To assure your request is received and processed in an expeditious manner, please include the asset requested, the date and location of the event in the subject line (i.e. Band Request-25July2016- Washington, D.C.). If you have not been contacted in 14 working days from your submitted request, please contact the nearest installation at the number listed in the locator map or MARFORRES COMREL at 504-697-8197 or 504-697-8308.

Aviation Support Requests

Thank you for your interest in a Marine Corps aviation asset at your event. The Marine Corps can provide aerial support such as fixed wing (jets, planes) or rotary (helicopters) in support community relations events. In order to get started, follow the directions below.










DIRECTIONS


1) Download and complete a DD Form 2535 (NEW
        DD FORM 2535 AS OF OCT 2021)
2) Send the Form to your local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) for approval by the FAA (flyovers and demos only)
3) Make sure the form is completely filled out then send it to HQMC.COMREL@USMC.MIL with the date and location of the
         event in the subject line(i.e. Static Display Request-25July2019-Southampton, New York) 






 Please do not mail or fax your completed DD Form 2535 since doing this will significantly increase processing time.
 If you have any changes regarding the request after it has been submitted/deemed eligible (event dates, points of contact, emails, telephone numbers), you must directly communicate that to the
          aviation liaison at HQMC.COMREL@USMC.MIL.  Failure to report any changes to the original request may result in aviation support for your event being canceled.
 If you need any additional assistance please call 703-614-1034 






Sponsor Requirements
AV-8B Harrier and MV-22 Osprey



Collapse All Expand All
  ELIGIBLE EVENT COORDINATION INFORMATION
Once we determine eligibility or non-eligibility of a request, we will send you an email notifying you whether your event meets DOD and Marine Corps criteria for eligibility. If eligible, you will be provided with a list of Public Affairs Offices at various
Marine Corps Bases with point of contact information. Contact these offices to further coordinate support of your request. However, please keep in mind that there is no guarantee a Marine Corps aviation unit can/will support your event, as
participation in public events is secondary to regularly scheduled training and operations. If your event is not eligible for Marine Corps participation, you will also be notified via email and provided a reason.

MCAS Public Affairs Offices contact info
MCAS Beaufort - Phone: 843-228-7201, Email: BFRT_JPAO@usmc.mil
MCAS Cherry Point (2nd MAW) - Phone: 252-466-3827, Email: 2ndmaw.commstrat@usmc.mil
MCAS Miramar (3rd MAW) - Phone: 858-603-6304 (M-F 8:00am-4pm PST), Email: 3rdmawmedia@usmc.mil
MCAS Yuma - Phone: 928-269-5505, Email: MCASYuma_Media@usmc.mil


  HARRIER OSPREY DEMONSTRATIONS
The AV-8B Harrier and the MV-22 Osprey flight demonstration is one of the most sought-after aerial demonstrations offered by the U.S. military. Demonstrations are performed by the same aircraft and Marines who train and deploy in support of
real-world contingencies. Therefore, Headquarters Marine Corps selects a handful of events to receive the coveted demonstration during the annual AV-8B Harrier and MV-22 Osprey flight demonstration board.
While the Marine Corps makes every effort to ensure selected sites receive designated aerial support, Marine Corps aviation units may cancel a scheduled appearance at any time due to unforeseen operational, training, or safety requirements.

  INTERNATIONAL REQUEST INFORMATION

For all international Marine Corps asset requests, please contact the Public Affairs office of the Unified Combatant Command in the respective area where the event will take place.
Those requests shall be forwarded through command channels to the ASD(PA) for approval. Approval shall be based on program, sponsor, site, support criteria, and upon any recommendations or requests for an exception to a policy offered by applicable commanders.”

  SPONSOR RESPONSIBILITIES
Please keep in mind that although your event may be eligible for support we may simply not be able to support it. With an increasingly high operations tempo and limited resources to meet our training and operational commitments we are required to take a hard look at all of our requests. So, understand that if we deny your request even though it may technically be eligible for support, we are not questioning the worthiness of the event, but rather enforcing Department of Defense and Marine Corps policy to preserve the operational and training requirements of our aerial units and to practice the prudent stewardship of taxpayer-financed resources.
The Marine Corps’ support of aerial events shall normally be at no additional cost to the Government. The Request for Military Aerial Support, DD Form 2535, will be utilized to determine the ability and willingness of the sponsors, military
or civilian, to defray costs of military participation.

  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
Instructions for submission are located on the last page of the DD Form 2535 (Page 5).  If you have any questions about any part of the form prior to submission, please contact Marine Corps Community Relations Office at 703-614-1034 or at hqmc.comrel@usmc.mil.
This form must be completed by the sponsoring organization, certified by the “owner” of the event site.  Approval by the local Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Flight Standards District office (FSDO) is required for all flyover and aircraft demo requests before submission to the Marine Corps Community Relations Office.

""Talent management is the act of aligning the talents of Marines with the needs of the Service to maximize the potential of both - increasing Marine Corps combat capability and readiness.""


— Gen. David Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps









TALENT MANAGEMENT 2030 | TALENT MANAGEMENT UPDATE









Strategic context


The Changing Character of War
Our success on emerging battlefields will depend on our force being more highly trained, cognitively mature, and operationally experienced. As we adapt to changing conditions, our purpose and our warfighting ethos will not change – the Marine Corps will remain the world’s premier expeditionary warfighting organization, maritime in nature, and poised to immediately respond to any crisis.









Talent Management To Date



SMALL UNIT LEADER INITIATIVE (SULI)
The SULI allows high-performing, committed, corporals with 36 months of service who have executed a reenlistment, and are eligible for promotion to be promoted to sergeant upon the recommendation of their commanding officer. SULI is intended to empower commanders with more tools to align the talents of top-performing, mature noncommissioned officers to Marine Corps warfighting needs. With this program, the Service will continue to work towards fully resourcing formations with the required Sergeant leadership. (MARADMIN 225/23)



EARLY REENLISTMENT AUTHORITY (ERA)
The ERA Program creates an opportunity for first-term Marines to take ownership of their career at an earlier decision point. This provides greater career path choice and predictability for Marines and their families as well as greater unit stability and return on investment to the Marine Corps. The initial FY 2022 ERA pilot program was limited to just 200 Marines. The cap was removed in FY 2023 resulting in more than 2,000 submissions by our most highly-qualified Marines. FY 2024 ERA opens 01 December 2023. (MARADMIN 590/22)



MARINE CORPS GRADUATE EDUCATION PROGRAM – ENLISTED (PILOT)
The MCGEP-E Pilot program opened attendance at the Naval Post-Graduate School (NPS) to selected enlisted Marines to earn a master’s degree in specific programs. Within 18 days of the announcement of this program, NPS received 48 applications. Of these, five Marines and three alternates were selected for the pilot. This investment in the education of our Marines will develop cohorts of enlisted professionals for duty in directed assignments critical to meet the challenges and complexity of the future operating environment. Later this year, we will assess the viability of making this a permanent program. (MARADMIN 007/23)



COMMANDANT'S
RETENTION PROGRAM (CRP)
The CRP provided pre-approved reenlistments for top-performing Marines along with priority access to duty station and assignment options. This effort resulted in a 72% increase of first-term reenlistment submissions by top-performing Marines, with the average reenlistment approval accomplished in 24
to 48 hours – a fraction of the average reenlistment approval time. (MARADMIN 271/23)



STAFF NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER (SNCO) PROMOTION BOARD REALIGNMENT
To better sequence promotions, assignments, and reenlistments, enlisted promotion boards in FY 2024 will be realigned. This will result in reduced disruptions to unit cohesion and reduced uncertainty to Marines and families. (MARADMIN 453/22)



SPECIAL DUTY ASSIGNMENT (SDA) VOLUNTEER INCENTIVES
The SDA Volunteer Incentives provided Active and Reserve Component Marines who volunteer for Special Duty Assignment with their preferred duty stations. This incentive resulted in a 62% increase of volunteers minimizing disruption to Marines, families, and Fleet Marine Force units, while also reducing SDA school attrition. (MARADMIN 311/22)



CAREER INTERMISSION
PROGRAM (CIP)
CIP allows Marines to temporarily pause active duty service and later resume their careers without penalty to enable career flexibility and encourage retention of experienced, talented Marines. CIP payback was reduced by half to one month of obligated active service for each month of intermission. We will closely assess the program to ensure it balances the need to sustain our professional fighting force and prevent loss of skill and familiarization. (MARADMIN 241/22)



DIGITAL BOARDROOM 2.0 (DBR 2.0)
DBR 2.0 increases the functionality and accuracy of information presented to board members, safeguards data, and improves this critical talent management process. The Enlisted Career Retention and Reserve Aviation Boards were successfully executed using the DBR 2.0. As DBR 2.0 use is expanded, the Marine Corps will assess outcomes, cost and time savings, and professional depth and breadth of board members to benchmark with our legacy process. 



MARINEVIEW 360-DEGREE LEADERSHIP REVIEW
The Marine Corps launched the MarineView360 Leadership Review pilot, a program designed as a leadership development tool that leverages a Marine’s supervisors, peers, and subordinates to identify hidden strengths and areas for improvement. The MarineView360 pilot began with sitting commanders and will significantly expand to include officer and enlisted leaders in the future.



OFFICER PROMOTION
OPT-OUT
The Officer Promotion Opt-Out initiative allows certain Active and Reserve Component in-zone officer populations to opt-out of consideration for promotion once, without penalty, to pursue unconventional career experiences or formal education, to increase the flexibility in officer career paths. The potential for offering this same flexibility to enlisted Marines is being explored. (MARADMIN 011/22) 



RECRUITING STATION COMMANDING OFFICER (RSCO) SELECTION BOARD
Commissioned officers eligible for recruiting station command consideration were offered two opportunities to increase career flexibility: volunteer and request removal. This change allowed officers to volunteer for command, including those not scheduled for consideration; and to request removal from consideration for one year, without penalty, to complete a deployment, personal or professional obligation. (MARADMIN 311/22)


 









The Way Ahead


Reorienting and reconfiguring our human resources enterprise into a talent management system is a work in progress, but one that is well underway and accelerating. The actions we have taken, and those we will take, ensure we will remain the Nation’s premier expeditionary force-in-readiness within a rapidly evolving world.

The initiatives below, nested within four mutually supporting lines of effort, are representative of those under consideration for development and decision during 2023.









Talent Management Campaign Lines of Effort














01: Rebalance Recruiting and Retention
02: Optimize the Employment of Talent
03: Multiple Pathways to Career Success
04: Modern Talent Management Digital Tools



LOE1: Rebalance Recruiting and Retention
Rebalance recruiting and retention to accelerate the shift from our legacy, high turnover “recruit and replace” personnel model toward one characterized by a greater emphasis on investment in, and retention of, our most capable Marines.
The Way Ahead


QUALITY OF LEADERSHIP, QUALITY OF LIFE, MARINE FAMILIES
Reevaluating policies with renewed focus on Marines’ and their families’ needs, including high-quality barracks, chow halls, family housing, childcare center capacity, and sufficient options for pediatric care.  Success will require supportive and engaged leadership, resourcing, and willingness to adopt new strategies.

TARGETED MATURATION
OF THE FORCE
The retention of trained, experienced, and proven Marines capitalizes on training investments and stands to increase our combat power and readiness.  As we invest more intense training and education in Marines to prepare for more complex battlefields, we will retain more of our highest performing Marines.

ENLISTED CAREER DESIGNATION
We are preparing a pilot program for designation and indefinite end of active service.  This would align SNCO and officer retention practices, increase flexibility in assignments, and reduce administrative burden and uncertainty for SNCOs and their families.

LATERAL ENTRY
We are developing a pilot process to bring in exceptionally talented Americans to meet critical shortfalls in highly specialized skills.  In selected cases that benefit our warfighting readiness, these highly-qualified Americans will earn the title “Marine” and enter service at a rank appropriate for their education and experience.



LOE2: Optimize the Employment of Talent
Optimize the employment of talent to maximize our warfighting capabilities by increasing the effectiveness and transparency of the assignments process to better utilize and retain our most talented Marines.
The Way Ahead


MODERN TALENT MANAGEMENT TOOLS
The Marine Corps will implement a data-first strategy coupled with modernized talent management tools to reduce non-EAS attrition, and improve entry-level training performance, alignment of skills, and job satisfaction. The 3 tools in development are: the Marine Corps Occupational Specialty Matching (MCOSM) tool, the Tailored Adaptive Personality Assessment System (TAPAS), and the Retention Prediction Network (RPN).

HONE INCENTIVES
Based on empirical evidence, we will continue to refine our balance of monetary and non-monetary incentives to reward our most talented and committed Marines who volunteer for assignments beneficial to the institution. This includes eliminating non-essential permanent change of station moves and incentivizing lateral moves to increase retention of proven Marines.

CONTINUE TO MINIMIZE NON-ESSENTIAL PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION (PCS) MOVES
We will continue to increase local Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) moves and decrease non-essential PCS moves.  This shift increases unit cohesion, saves money, and reduces unnecessary strain on Marines and their families.

PROGRAM ENLISTED FOR REFORM
We are reexamining the manner in which we classify and assign recruits to specific MOSs.  The future system will more logically group MOSs and improve alignment of a recruit’s aptitude and desires with the needs of the Marine Corps.  We will also differentiate prerequisites for newly accessed Marines from experienced Marines who laterally move into a new MOS.

INCREASED RETURN ON INVESTMENT
Increased Return on Investment (ROI) – The service will explore revising personnel policies to enhance Service capability and return on investment, such as extending enlistment durations, offering conditions-based extensions, early reenlistment, and graduate education for SNCOs.



LOE3: Multiple Pathways To Career Success
As modern battlefields continue to demand more diversity of skills, expertise, and perspectives, we must adapt to accommodate multiple pathways to career success through career initiatives that account for evolving interests and personal development over the course of a Marine Corps career.
The Way Ahead


INCENTIVIZING LATERAL MOVES AND RETENTION
In FY24, we will present pre-approved lateral move options to talented Marines whose primary MOSs are already filled. We will also identify and remove barriers hindering lateral moves while exploiting incentives, such as fixed school dates and guaranteed follow-on orders, to help our most dedicated Marines fill gaps in critical fields.

ACTIVE AND RESERVE
PERMEABILITY
We seek to increase permeability between active and reserve components and take full advantage of opportunities for Total Force collaboration to increase our combat readiness.  Given the nature of legislative limitations on reserve employment, we will work closely with Congress to seek assistance in identifying specific opportunities for AC-RC permeability.

OFFICER TECHNICAL CAREER PATHS
Officers who obtain Marine Corps-funded technical skills at graduate-level schools bring unique capabilities and perspectives to the Service.  We will better capitalize on their expertise, increase our organizational performance, and maximize our return on investment in ways that are compatible with career success.



LOE4: Modern Talent Management Tools
Modernize talent management digital tools and data systems to synthesize personnel information and requirements across the force via a transparent, commander-focused, collaborative system to better align the individual abilities, skills, and aspirations of our Marines to our warfighting requirements.
The Way Ahead


MODERNIZE DATA MANAGEMENT
By implementing a data-first strategy focused on transforming, securing, and defending our personnel data, we will be able to promote, educate, develop, and retain our talent more effectively. We will begin by standardizing and aggregating our personnel data into a common data environment.

TALENT MANAGEMENT ENGAGEMENT PORTAL
We must field a transparent tool that integrates information to optimize assignments decisions. The platform will include a customer relationship management platform capable of advanced analytics and machine learning, as well as portals for Marines, monitors, and commands in a market-style assignment system.

AGILE TALENT EMPLOYMENT (GIG EAGLE)
This talent marketplace connects reserve personnel with specialized skill sets from across the Department of Defense with commands to fill immediate mission requirements. By breaking down barriers between branches and components, this program will allow Marine commands to unlock the talent within the RC and tactically apply their skills to support the mission at hand.
















Read The Update


""Marines depart recruit training having earned the title “Marine.” We must honor our commitment to them as they arrive in our operating forces expecting meaningful and challenging training, and a culture of professionalism, pride, mutual trust, and respect. I challenge leaders at all echelons to create an environment in which individual merit is fostered, identified, and rewarded.""
- Gen. David Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps.

Training and Education 2030




















""A warfighting capability is only as effective as the Marines employing it.""


— Gen. David Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps











The Problem


The current training and education system is not preparing the Marine Corps with the knowledge and range of skills required for the future operating environment.







Our Vision




MODERNIZATION
• Training in support of emerging concepts and mission sets will require new, converted, or repurposed training areas
• Reimagining training and education requires the application of information-age learning tools such as technology-enabled classrooms, digitized courseware, and robotic targets
• Modern learning methods and a student-centered approach requires a talented instructor cadre and yields high-caliber Marines


TRAINING REIMAGINED
• Create a globally connected live-virtual- constructive training environment that enables realistic training for all-domain warfare
• Expand integrated naval training to prepare Marines to seamlessly deploy and employ integrated fires in the naval and joint fight
• Encourage Marines to accelerate and expand their learning through incentivized skills progression


STANDARDS
• Rigorous and repeatable standards will continue to form the foundation for all training, education, and assessment
• We will hold-fast to our immutable high standards to continue building upon the legacy of the generations of Marines who came before us
• The title “Marine” is always earned and we will not compromise the standards that define what it is to become a Marine











Our Goal


The Marine Corps training and education ecosystem leverages technology, is data-driven, and effectively utilizes available resources to develop Marines who are cognitively agile, intuitive problem solvers, capable of making bold and consequential decisions in an uncertain environment.







 
How We Will Do It




DOCTRINE

Installations and Logistics 2030




















""We cannot continue to rely on the processes and procedures of yesterday and expect them to meet the challenges and threats of tomorrow.""


— Gen. David Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps











The Problem


The current logistical capabilities are under-resourced and do not meet the demands of our future force to succeed on future battlefields, and our installations are currently unable to provide the full range of essential services support, infrastructure, and trained personnel that directly link to the emerging requirements of the future force.







Our Vision







DOCTRINAL UPDATE: MCDP-4
ONGOING LOGISTICS EXPERIMENTATION
OPTIMIZING INSTALLATIONS




• The Marine Corps’ view of logistics is based on our common understanding of the nature of war, our role in the joint force, and our warfighting philosophy as described in Marine Corps Doctrinal Publication (MCDP) 1, Warfighting.
• This publication is a revision of the 1997 version of MCDP 4. We revised the doctrine because, “like war itself, our approach to warfighting must evolve.”
• This publication describes the role of logistics in a globally contested environment, where supply lines are stretched thin due to distance, and partners and allies have never been more important. Marines must be able to operate when logistics is contested, because increasingly persistent and global threats reinforce the need to leverage strategic- and operational-level logistics to support Marines.
(Download and read MCDP-4: Logistics)



• Logistics concept and structure do not always conform to traditional live force experimentation methods and sufficient Service-level experimentation capacity does not exist for all Force Design 2030 initiatives.
• The Service, through the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL), will leverage the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) and Supporting Establishment units and activities to conduct live, virtual, and/or constructive force experimentation of FD2030-related logistics concepts and organizational structure changes to inform further planning, refinement, investments, divestments, and decisions.
• This logistics focused experimentation effort will be nested within greater MCWI, Service Level Experimentation Campaign.



• The Marine Corps’ 25 installations provide the foundation for its readiness, forward presence, and ability to project power.
• The Marine Corps’ historical presence in the Pacific means its bases and stations in this region are especially significant and face unique challenges given the Department of Defense’s focus on China as the pacing challenge.
• As we imagine the future of logistics, we anticipate our installations will be required to make greater contributions to the sustainment network in support of the future force, particularly in forward locations.
• The Marine Corps organic industrial base (MCOIB), which includes our supply and maintenance depots, requires modernization to support rapid deployment and sustainment.















Our Goal


The Marine Corps installations and logistics ecosystem will succeed on tomorrow’s battlefields by employing a logistics enterprise fully integrated with the broader objectives of Force Design 2030, capable of supporting multi-domain and distributed operations in contested environments.







 
How We Will Do It




CREATE GLOBAL LOGISTICS AWARENESS
Findings from FD2030 planning and wargames indicate that to achieve resilient logistics networks, we need to view and understand our logistics resources differently than we have in the past. We will need tools to help commanders visualize logistics resources in space and time across the JLEnt. This will give us the ability to provide sustainment and distribution options based on threat, inventory position, and protection requirements.

DIVERSIFYDISTRIBUTION
Diversifying distribution refers to creating options in the methods, nodes, and modes available to the MCILE in staging, delivery, retrograde, and recovery of assets and logistics services to deployed forces. This objective addresses the need to capitalize on both existing and emerging distribution capabilities to support geographically dispersed forces in contested environments.

IMPROVESUSTAINMENT
Meeting sustainment requirements in contested areas will require Marines to plan for multiple methods of sustainment across each of the six functions of logistics. To provide this flexibility to forward forces, we will reimagine planning and execution for the logistics warfighting function and how it aligns to support the other warfighting functions. When feasible and appropriate, we will leverage demand reduction principles and technologies to reduce requirements and cumbersome stockpiles.

MAKE THE INSTALLATIONS READY FOR A CONTESTED ENVIRONMENT
As we adapt to the demands of all-domain battlefields, advancements in technology, and the challenges of peer and near-peer competition, our installations will play an even greater role supporting our warfighting concepts than in recent past. Smart, resilient, networked installations will provide stand-in forces with enhanced capabilities to recover quickly from attack, persist in contested spaces, and sustain distributed formations across multiple axes.

DEVELOP LOGISTICS PROFESSIONALS FOR 21ST CENTURY
There is no resource more precious or more critical to the continued success of our Corps than our Marines and civilians. Today, our senior logisticians have a wealth of combat and deployed experience that we must leverage to develop the knowledge and understanding of those who are just now entering our ranks. We have a unique opportunity to adapt their collective experience into future concepts and doctrine and will do so by incorporating past lessons and best practices into our training and education curricula.

Think unmanned and uncrewed systems, as well as manned-unmanned teaming, particularly in transportation capabilities on the ground, at sea, under the sea, in the air, and in space.  The shift to autonomous systems has applicability in the public sector, as well, which is why there is such ripe opportunity for us to move forward rapidly.  For military application, unmanned and uncrewed systems provide huge opportunities for sustaining a force in the fight.  Although we must balance this with affordability and accountability.


The Marine Corps is already providing subject matter expertise over global distances with encrypted digital chats to discuss troubleshooting of weapon systems, and even conducting maintenance at echelons normally higher than the on-site mechanic is familiar with.  We are doing this with aviation and ground platforms.  This is currently occurring regularly between U.S. forces and Ukrainians who are learning to conduct maintenance on equipment sourced from the U.S.  Telemedicine for clinical services is becoming more acceptable.  Further growth in tele-surgery has resulted in specialized surgeons on one end assisting a general surgeon at the remote end, and even remote robotic surgery.  This is a very small field now, although the opportunities to expand this to the tactical edge will save lives, particularly in remote locations with limited casualty evacuation capability and availability.


3D, additive, and subtractive manufacturing reduces the time and distance for distribution of a repair part.  It increases responsiveness at the point and time of need.  Among many challenges are technical data rights and permissions, certification for tensile strength of weight bearing parts, and the impact on the manufacturing lines back at home.  Large-format, concrete 3D printing and other variations of construction 3D printing are also very applicable to support rapid deliberate military construction, as well as recovery of facilities after an attack.  The ability of a young Marine to conduct tactical level manufacturing on the front lines will save lives, particularly in a distributed, contested operating environment.


Alternative energy reduces the demand to transport liquid fuel over thousands of miles.  Each alternative energy option comes with new challenges in sustainability, safety, and form factor.  Regenerative energy is critical to ensure the force does not culminate during the fight or even before the fight begins.  Alternative energy is also directly related to our installations, where we are leaning forward with proofs of concept in alternative energy options to include solar and biomass steam turbines.  Partnership with local businesses and communities will enhance our base and local community energy resiliency, which is critical to mission assurance.


Leveraging data to enhance decision making to provide the right support, to the right place, at the right time.  We are looking to learn from commercial benchmarks that have shown us what is in the realm of the possible.  While not intending to advertise for specific brands, two benchmarks that are worth noting are Amazon and FedEx.
-The user interface that so many of us find to be second nature in the Amazon app to rapidly search multiple sources of supply and choose an item based on cost, delivery time, or condition, provides a model for how we want our Marines to be able to search quickly for options and make the right purchase to meet mission.  Behind that user interface is a large data pool connected to warehouses and distribution options, as well as the fiscal connections, to rapidly initiate supply responsiveness. 
-The second example is FedEx, which uses data science and machine learning to help make distribution more efficient.  FedEx uses data to reflect real time distribution across air and ground services, as well as the predictive analytics to anticipate impacts due to disruptive weather and even geopolitical shifts.  Further, these models provide options for rerouting that support centralized human decision making for risk mitigation.







 







Read The Report


""One broken link in a supply chain can result in an untethered force,"" said Lt. Gen. Edward Banta, Deputy Commandant for Installations and Logistics. ""A web mentality assures sustainment of the force, and can absorb disruption."" The new Marine Corps operating concept driving much of our future force structure, posture, and capabilities is the Concept for Stand-in Forces. These ""Stand-in Forces are small, low signature, mobile, relatively simple-to-maintain-and-sustain forces designed to operate across the competition continuum within a contested area.  They are the leading edge of a maritime defense-in-depth in order to intentionally disrupt the plans of a potential or actual adversary,"" according to the concept.

Military Units


  

MARINE CORPS

  


The U.S. Marine Corps falls under the Department of the Navy; however its command structure is similar to the Army’s, except it follows the “rule of three” and includes Marine expeditionary forces and aircraft wings. The Marines are divided into four groups: the operating forces that do the actual fighting, the headquarters for leadership, the supporting establishment that provides logistical support, and the Marine Corps Reserve.

Command Structure


Basic Units

Expeditionary Forces

Aircraft Units

While the Marine Corps falls under the Department of the Navy, its command structure is similar to the Army’s, with teams, squadrons, platoons and battalions, except it follows the “rule of three,” meaning there are usually three of each lower unit within the next larger unit.
VIEW MARINE UNITS


The Marine Corps’ principal warfighting organization during large crises is the Marine expeditionary force. The Corps has three MEFs, and each is made up of ground, air and logistics forces. They act as standing Marine air-ground task forces in peacetime and war. MEFs are capable of projecting power on land or at sea and are able to support themselves in combat for up to 60 days.
VIEW EXPEDITIONARY FORCES


Another exception to the basic unit structure is Marine aviation, which is broken down into commands made of squadrons, groups and wings. The squadron is the basic tactical and administrative unit. One or more squadrons form a group, and one or more groups form a wing.

COMMAND STRUCTURE





squadronsAircraft Units



squadrons



Equivalent to a battalion


Made up of

24aircraft





Marine aviation squadrons are about the size equivalent of a battalion and are organized by aircraft type – fixed-wing aircraft, tiltrotor aircraft and helicopters - although there are nonflying squadrons, too, such as those for logistics. Squadrons are expected to execute a list of specified mission-essential tasks. For example, Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121 is based at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan, as the first forward-deployed permanent F-35B Lightning II squadron.






GroupsAircraft Units



groups



Equivalent to a regiment


Made up of

3squadrons





Three or more squadrons form a group, which is equivalent in size to a regiment. There are several kinds of groups: aircraft, air control, training support and wing support. Aircraft groups are made up of the aircraft themselves and the people who support them to fly; air control groups coordinate all aspects of air command and air defense. Support groups provide administrative duties, ceremonial support and special-detail advisors.






WingsAircraft Units



wings



Equivalent to a division


Made up of

3groups





There are currently four active Marine aircraft wings. The 1st MAW is part of III MEF and has been a key player in providing humanitarian aid to disaster areas in the Indo-Pacific. The 2nd MAW has deployed in support of noncombat operations in Iraq in the 1990s, as well as combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan throughout this century. The 3rd MAW is deployed in support of operations in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. The 4th MAW is a subordinate command of the Marine Corps Reserve.

Brief History of the United States Marine Corps

 
On November 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia passed a resolution stating that ""two Battalions of Marines be raised"" for service as landing forces with the fleet. This resolution established the Continental Marines and marked the birth date of the United States Marine Corps. Serving on land and at sea, these first Marines distinguished themselves in a number of important operations, including their first amphibious raid into the Bahamas in March 1776, under the command of Captain (later Major) Samuel Nicholas. The first commissioned officer in the Continental Marines, Nicholas remained the senior Marine officer throughout the American Revolution and is considered to be the first Marine Commandant. The Treaty of Paris in April 1783 brought an end to the Revolutionary War and as the last of the Navy's ships were sold, the Continental Navy and Marines went out of existence.
Following the Revolutionary War and the formal re-establishment of the Marine Corps on 11 July 1798, Marines saw action in the quasi-war with France, landed in Santo Domingo, and took part in many operations against the Barbary pirates along the ""Shores of Tripoli"".
Marines took part in numerous naval operations during the War of 1812, as well as participating in the defense of Washington at Bladensburg, Maryland, and fought alongside Andrew Jackson in the defeat of the British at New Orleans.
The decades following the War of 1812 saw the Marines protecting American interests around the world, in the Caribbean, at the Falkland Islands, Sumatra and off the coast of West Africa, and also close to home in operations against the Seminole Indians in Florida.
During the Mexican War (1846-1848), Marines seized enemy seaports on both the Gulf and Pacific coasts. A battalion of Marines joined General Winfield Scott's army at Pueblo and fought all the way to the ""Halls of Montezuma,"" Mexico City. Marines also served ashore and afloat in the Civil War (1861-1865). Although most service was with the Navy, a battalion fought at Bull Run and other units saw action with the blockading squadrons and at Cape Hatteras, New Orleans, Charleston, and Fort Fisher. The last third of the 19th century saw Marines making numerous landings throughout the world, especially in the Orient and in the Caribbean area.

Following the Spanish-American War (1898), in which Marines performed with valor in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, the Corps entered an era of expansion and professional development.
It saw active service in the Philippine Insurrection (1899-1902), the Boxer Rebellion in China (1900). and in numerous other nations, including Nicaragua, Panama, Cuba, Mexico, and Haiti.
 
 
 
 
In World War I the Marine Corps distinguished itself on the battlefields of France as the 4th Marine Brigade earned the title of ""Devil Dogs"" for heroic action during 1918 at Belleau Wood, Soissons, St. Michiel, Blanc Mont, and in the final Meuse-Argonne offensive.

 
Marine aviation, which dates from 1912, also played a part in the war effort, as Marine pilots flew day bomber missions over France and Belgium. More than 30,000 Marines served in France and more than a third were killed or wounded in six months of intense fighting.
During the two decades before World War II, the Marine Corps began to develop in earnest the doctrine, equipment, and organization needed for amphibious warfare. The success of this effort was proven first on Guadalcanal, then on Bougainville, Tarawa, New Britain, Kwajalein, Eniwetok, Saipan, Guam, Tinian, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. By the end of the war in 1945, the Marine Corps had grown to include six divisions, five air wings, and supporting troops. Its strength in World War II peaked at 485,113. The war cost the Marines nearly 87,000 dead and wounded, and 82 Marines had earned the Medal of Honor.
While Marine units took part in the post-war occupation of Japan and North China, studies were undertaken at Quantico, Virginia, which concentrated on attaining a ""vertical envelopment"" capability for the Corps through the use of helicopters.
 
Landing at Inchon, Korea in September 1950, Marines proved that the doctrine of amphibious assault was still viable and necessary. After the recapture of Seoul, the Marines advanced to the Chosin Reservoir only to see the Chinese Communists enter the war. After years of offensives, counter-offensives, seemingly endless trench warfare, and occupation duty, the last Marine ground troops were withdrawn in March 1955. More than 25,000 Marines were killed or wounded during the Korean War.
In July 1958, a brigade-size force landed in Lebanon to restore order. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, a large amphibious force was marshaled but not landed. In April 1965, a brigade of Marines landed in the Dominican Republic to protect Americans and evacuate those who wished to leave.
The landing of the 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade at Da Nang in 1965 marked the beginning of large-scale Marine involvement in Vietnam. By summer 1968, after the enemy's Tet Offensive, Marine Corps strength in Vietnam rose to a peak of approximately 85,000. The Marine withdrawal began in 1969 as the South Vietnamese began to assume a larger role in the fighting; the last Marine ground forces were out of Vietnam by June 1971.
The Vietnam War, longest in the history of the Marine Corps, exacted a high cost as well with over 13,000 Marines killed and more than 88,000 wounded. In the spring of 1975, Marines evacuated embassy staffs, American citizens, and refugees in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Saigon, Republic of Vietnam. In May, Marines played an integral role in the rescue of the crew of the SS Mayaguezcaptured off the coast of Cambodia.
The mid-1970s saw the Marine Corps assume an increasingly significant role in defending NATO's northern flank as amphibious units of the 2d Marine Division participated in exercises throughout northern Europe. The Marine Corps also played a key role in the development of the Rapid Deployment Force, a multi-service organization created to insure a flexible, timely military response around the world when needed. The Maritime Prepositioning Ships (MPS) concept was developed to enhance this capability by prestaging equipment needed for combat in the vicinity of the designated area of operations, and reduce response time as Marines travel by air to link up with MPS assets.
The 1980s brought an increasing number of terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies around the world. Marine Security Guards, under the direction of the State Department, continued to serve with distinction in the face of this challenge. In August 1982, Marine units landed at Beirut, Lebanon, as part of the multi-national peace-keeping force. For the next 19 months these units faced the hazards of their mission with courage and professionalism. In October 1983, Marines took part in the highly successful, short-notice intervention in Grenada. As the decade of the 1980s came to a close, Marines were summoned to respond to instability in Central America. Operation Just Cause was launched in Panama in December 1989 to protect American lives and restore the democratic process in that nation.
Less than a year later, in August 1990, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait set in motion events that would lead to the largest movement of Marine Corps forces since World War II. Between August 1990 and January 1991, some 24 infantry battalions, 40 squadrons, and more than 92,000 Marines deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Desert Shield. Operation Desert Storm was launched 16 January 1991, the day the air campaign began.
The main attack came overland beginning 24 February when the 1st and 2d Marine Divisions breached the Iraqi defense lines and stormed into occupied Kuwait. By the morning of February 28, 100 hours after the ground war began, almost the entire Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti theater of operations had been encircled, with 4,000 tanks destroyed and 42 divisions destroyed or rendered ineffective.
Overshadowed by the events in the Persian Gulf during 1990-91, were a number of other significant Marine deployments demonstrating the Corps' flexible and rapid response. Included among these were non-combatant evacuation operations in Liberia and Somalia and humanitarian lifesaving operations in Bangladesh, the Philippines, and northern Iraq.
In December 1992, Marines landed in Somalia marking the beginning of a two-year humanitarian relief operation in that famine-stricken and strife-torn nation. In another part of the world, Marine Corps aircraft supported Operation Deny Flight in the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina. During April 1994, Marines once again demonstrated their ability to protect American citizens in remote parts of the world when a Marine task force evacuated U.S. citizens from Rwanda in response to civil unrest in that country.
Closer to home, Marines went ashore in September 1994 in Haiti as part of the U.S. force participating in the restoration of democracy in that country. During this same period Marines were actively engaged in providing assistance to the Nation's counter-drug effort, assisting in battling wild fires in the western United States, and aiding in flood and hurricane relief operations.
The Marine Corps continued its tradition of innovation to meet the challenges of a new century. The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory was created in 1995 to evaluate change, assess the impact of new technologies on warfighting, and expedite the introduction of new capabilities into the operating forces of the Marine Corps. Exercises such as “Hunter Warrior,” and “Urban Warrior” were designed to explore future tactical concepts, and to examine facets of military operations in urban environments.
During the late 1990's, Marine Corps units deployed to several African nations, including Liberia, the Central African Republic, Zaire, and Eritrea, in order to provide security and assist in the evacuation of American citizens during periods of political and civil instability in those nations.
Humanitarian and disaster relief operations were also conducted by Marines during 1998 in Kenya, and in the Central American nations of Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In 1999, Marine units deployed to Kosovo in support of Operation Allied Force. Soon after the September 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C., Marine units deployed to the Arabian Sea and in November set up a forward operating base in southern Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.
In 2002, the Marine Corps continued to play a key role in the Global War on Terrorism. Marines operated in diverse locations, from Afghanistan, to the Arabian Gulf, to the Horn of Africa and the Philippines. Early 2003 saw the largest deployment of Marine forces since the Persian Gulf War of 1990-91 when 76,000 Marines deployed to the Central Command area for combat operations against Iraq.
 
 
The I Marine Expeditionary Force, including Task Force Tarawa and the United Kingdom’s 1st Armored Division, were the first conventional ground units to enter Iraq in late March as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Fixed-wing and helicopter aircraft from the 3d Marine Air Wing provided continuous close air and assault support to Marine and coalition units as they drove deeper into Iraq. On the ground, Marines from I MEF moved nearly 400 miles from the Kuwait border to Baghdad and Tikrit, Iraq, and eliminated the last organized resistance by Iraqi military forces. Although I MEF would transition to stabilization and security operations and then redeploy to the U.S. by late September, I MEF began preparing for a return to Iraq in early 2004.
The adaptability and reliability of Marine forces continued to be highlighted around the world from the Horn of Africa to Haiti and to the Philippines.
 
 
Across the U.S., Marine units from both coasts fought and contained wildfires, and also supported hurricane relief efforts in various parts of the country. In December, 2004, a tsunami struck numerous nations in the Indian Ocean region killing more than 150,000 and causing enormous devastation. Marine units from III MEF were immediately deployed to Thailand, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka to assist in disaster relief operations.
In early 2005, the II Marine Expeditionary Force replaced I MEF in Iraq as the primary focus began to shift to partnership operations with the Iraqi Security Forces. Marine units continued to provide air and ground support to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Closer to home, the flexibility and responsiveness of the Navy/Marine team was exhibited during September and October when nearly 3000 Marines and sailors conducted search and rescue, humanitarian relief, and disaster recovery operations in Louisiana and Mississippi in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Today's Marine Corps stands ready to continue in the proud tradition of those who so valiantly fought and died at Belleau Wood, Iwo Jima, the Chosin Reservoir, and Khe Sanh. Combining a long and proud heritage of faithful service to the nation, with the resolve to face tomorrow's challenges will continue to keep the Marine Corps the ""best of the best.""

                    Morale has been an important part of the Marine Corps since its founding and as all good leaders will attest, it’s also a key to the success of Marines and their families wherever they serve.

For decades, Lunga Recreation area and Reservoir was a favorite location for locals to relax, fish, camp, host command events, and even celebrate holidays like the fourth of July. In February 2012, after partially exposed mortar fins were found in the recreational area, Lunga was temporarily closed while Naval Facilities Engineering Command, and the Marine Corps explosives safety authority conducted an area survey to determine if the park was safe for continued use...

Tobacco and Stress: Not a Winning Combination
Most people understand that tobacco harms a person’s health, but many users also believe it helps them cope with stress. Nicotine is a mood altering drug, so at first tobacco may seems to help ease the effects of stress such as feelings of frustration, anger, or anxiety. This is because the nicotine in tobacco causes the brain to release a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine results in an initial sense of calm and well-being and causes your body to crave that sensation again and again. Really, this is just an illusion; while a person may feel an initial sense of calm when they use tobacco, the body is actually under increased stress. Blood pressure and heart rate increase, muscles become tense, and blood vessels constrict so less oxygen is available to the brain and body to facilitate healthy coping. The initial feelings of stress are still present, but simply masked.

The President's Own: Established in 1798 to provide music for the President of the United States and the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Their calendar includes chamber and symphony performances, live concerts, and VIP events such as state dinners. 


CALENDAR


U.S. Marine Drum and Bugle Corps: Officially established in 1956 and is located at the oldest post of the Corps. Experience the excitement of the premier musical marching unit throughout the summer at the Tuesday and Friday night parades located in Washington, D.C.


PARADE INFORMATION


Marine Corps Bands: Trained combat warriors, who have marched with commands since the inception of the Corps. They support military ceremonies, official activities and provide security in times of war. From local ceremonies to live community performances, find a field band performance near you.

testimonials
""The MCEF exceeded my expectations, and I had high expectations going into the day. As I reflect on what had the greatest impact on me, I cannot shake the unmistakable bond all of the Marines had. Clearly the Corps attracts, trains, retains and otherwise produces high achievers. I look forward to recruiting a few of your colleagues!”
- MCEF Participant
 
“I was very impressed with every Marine I came across. Marines are articulate, leaders, fit, squared-away, respectful, well mannered, demonstrate advanced knowledge in their area of operation, and all around well-rounded. Marines truly are special. I'm now an empowered and educated ambassador for the Marines. After this experience, I will tell every business owner/H.R. person: Hire a Marine.  I think you can train a Marine to do just about any job you have. They are leaders, very hard working, polite and doers.""

Sponsor Requirements

Collapse All Expand All
  SPONSOR RESPONSIBILITIES
When a request is made by an organization for Marine Corps assets, you as the event organizer are designated as the “sponsor” on the DD-2536. Please understand that events are covered based on availability of the unit to participate and will only be authorized when such support does not interfere with mission or training programs. In all cases, operational commitments take priority and can cause previously scheduled appearances to be cancelled. It is the sponsor’s responsibility to coordinate and keep a dialogue with the unit to ensure that circumstances don’t change and the unit is still able to attend the event in the days prior to your event.
Department of Defense policies require that Armed Forces participation in public events will be provided at no additional cost to the Government. The sponsor is required to pay, when necessary, the standard Military Services allowance for quarters and meals for all Armed Forces participants and for other services which have been determined in advance by the Military Services and agreed to by the sponsor. Transportation and meal costs are not usually incurred when support is provided from a local military installation. However, circumstances may dictate that reimbursement for any or all of these costs may be necessary. All costs are binding after a unit, personnel, or exhibit has arrived at an event site even though weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances may force the event to be cancelled. Please note, Armed Forces musical units are organized for ceremonial and traditional purposes and to support recruiting activities. However, they may be authorized to provide certain specified presentations (such as patriotic ceremonies) for public programs.  Armed Forces musical organizations are not permitted to provide entertainment, background, dinner, dance, or other social music at public or private events in competition with the customary or regular employment of local civilian musicians.
 

  INTERNATIONAL REQUEST INFORMATION
For all international Marine Corps asset requests, please contact the Public Affairs office of the Unified Combatant Command in the respective area where the event will take place.
Those requests shall be forwarded through command channels to the ASD(PA) for approval. Approval shall be based upon program, sponsor, site, support criteria, and upon any recommendations or requests for an exception to a policy offered by applicable commanders.

  REQUEST SUPPORT
Please complete the information requested in the DD-2536 completely, as incomplete requests will not be processed.  Submit your request 30-90 days in advance in order to ensure the minimum amount of planning and coordination by the supporting unit to support your event. Submit your request form to a Marine Corps installation within 60 miles of your event location (see band locator map). If you are not within 60 miles of the Marine Corps installation, please submit your request to Marine Forces Reserve Community Relations at mfrcomrel@usmc.mil. Do not fax your request. To assure your request is received and processed in an expeditious manner, please include the asset requested, the date and location of the event in the subject line (i.e. Band Request-25July2016- Washington, D.C.). If you have not been contacted in 14 working days from your submitted request, please contact the nearest installation at the number listed in the locator map or MARFORRES COMREL at 504-697-8197 or 504-697-8308.

Aviation Support Requests

Thank you for your interest in a Marine Corps aviation asset at your event. The Marine Corps can provide aerial support such as fixed wing (jets, planes) or rotary (helicopters) in support community relations events. In order to get started, follow the directions below.










DIRECTIONS


1) Download and complete a DD Form 2535 (NEW
        DD FORM 2535 AS OF OCT 2021)
2) Send the Form to your local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) for approval by the FAA (flyovers and demos only)
3) Make sure the form is completely filled out then send it to HQMC.COMREL@USMC.MIL with the date and location of the
         event in the subject line(i.e. Static Display Request-25July2019-Southampton, New York) 






 Please do not mail or fax your completed DD Form 2535 since doing this will significantly increase processing time.
 If you have any changes regarding the request after it has been submitted/deemed eligible (event dates, points of contact, emails, telephone numbers), you must directly communicate that to the
          aviation liaison at HQMC.COMREL@USMC.MIL.  Failure to report any changes to the original request may result in aviation support for your event being canceled.
 If you need any additional assistance please call 703-614-1034

  ELIGIBLE EVENT COORDINATION INFORMATION
Once we determine eligibility or non-eligibility of a request, we will send you an email notifying you whether your event meets DOD and Marine Corps criteria for eligibility. If eligible, you will be provided with a list of Public Affairs Offices at various
Marine Corps Bases with point of contact information. Contact these offices to further coordinate support of your request. However, please keep in mind that there is no guarantee a Marine Corps aviation unit can/will support your event, as
participation in public events is secondary to regularly scheduled training and operations. If your event is not eligible for Marine Corps participation, you will also be notified via email and provided a reason.

  HARRIER OSPREY DEMONSTRATIONS
The AV-8B Harrier and the MV-22 Osprey flight demonstration is one of the most sought-after aerial demonstrations offered by the U.S. military. Demonstrations are performed by the same aircraft and Marines who train and deploy in support of
real-world contingencies. Therefore, Headquarters Marine Corps selects a handful of events to receive the coveted demonstration during the annual AV-8B Harrier and MV-22 Osprey flight demonstration board.
While the Marine Corps makes every effort to ensure selected sites receive designated aerial support, Marine Corps aviation units may cancel a scheduled appearance at any time due to unforeseen operational, training, or safety requirements.

  INTERNATIONAL REQUEST INFORMATION

For all international Marine Corps asset requests, please contact the Public Affairs office of the Unified Combatant Command in the respective area where the event will take place.
Those requests shall be forwarded through command channels to the ASD(PA) for approval. Approval shall be based on program, sponsor, site, support criteria, and upon any recommendations or requests for an exception to a policy offered by applicable commanders.”

  SPONSOR RESPONSIBILITIES
Please keep in mind that although your event may be eligible for support we may simply not be able to support it. With an increasingly high operations tempo and limited resources to meet our training and operational commitments we are required to take a hard look at all of our requests. So, understand that if we deny your request even though it may technically be eligible for support, we are not questioning the worthiness of the event, but rather enforcing Department of Defense and Marine Corps policy to preserve the operational and training requirements of our aerial units and to practice the prudent stewardship of taxpayer-financed resources.
The Marine Corps’ support of aerial events shall normally be at no additional cost to the Government. The Request for Military Aerial Support, DD Form 2535, will be utilized to determine the ability and willingness of the sponsors, military
or civilian, to defray costs of military participation.

  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
Instructions for submission are located on the last page of the DD Form 2535 (Page 5).  If you have any questions about any part of the form prior to submission, please contact Marine Corps Community Relations Office at 703-614-1034 or at hqmc.comrel@usmc.mil.
This form must be completed by the sponsoring organization, certified by the “owner” of the event site.  Approval by the local Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Flight Standards District office (FSDO) is required for all flyover and aircraft demo requests before submission to the Marine Corps Community Relations Office.

On Point







On Point 1 of {y} Click here to download and read the Talent Management 2030 Update
                      




















""Talent management is the act of aligning the talents of Marines with the needs of the Service to maximize the potential of both - increasing Marine Corps combat capability and readiness.""


— Gen. David Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps









TALENT MANAGEMENT 2030 | TALENT MANAGEMENT UPDATE









Strategic context


The Changing Character of War
Our success on emerging battlefields will depend on our force being more highly trained, cognitively mature, and operationally experienced. As we adapt to changing conditions, our purpose and our warfighting ethos will not change – the Marine Corps will remain the world’s premier expeditionary warfighting organization, maritime in nature, and poised to immediately respond to any crisis.









Talent Management To Date



SMALL UNIT LEADER INITIATIVE (SULI)
The SULI allows high-performing, committed, corporals with 36 months of service who have executed a reenlistment, and are eligible for promotion to be promoted to sergeant upon the recommendation of their commanding officer. SULI is intended to empower commanders with more tools to align the talents of top-performing, mature noncommissioned officers to Marine Corps warfighting needs. With this program, the Service will continue to work towards fully resourcing formations with the required Sergeant leadership. (MARADMIN 225/23)



EARLY REENLISTMENT AUTHORITY (ERA)
The ERA Program creates an opportunity for first-term Marines to take ownership of their career at an earlier decision point. This provides greater career path choice and predictability for Marines and their families as well as greater unit stability and return on investment to the Marine Corps. The initial FY 2022 ERA pilot program was limited to just 200 Marines. The cap was removed in FY 2023 resulting in more than 2,000 submissions by our most highly-qualified Marines. FY 2024 ERA opens 01 December 2023. (MARADMIN 590/22)



MARINE CORPS GRADUATE EDUCATION PROGRAM – ENLISTED (PILOT)
The MCGEP-E Pilot program opened attendance at the Naval Post-Graduate School (NPS) to selected enlisted Marines to earn a master’s degree in specific programs. Within 18 days of the announcement of this program, NPS received 48 applications. Of these, five Marines and three alternates were selected for the pilot. This investment in the education of our Marines will develop cohorts of enlisted professionals for duty in directed assignments critical to meet the challenges and complexity of the future operating environment. Later this year, we will assess the viability of making this a permanent program. (MARADMIN 007/23)



COMMANDANT'S
RETENTION PROGRAM (CRP)
The CRP provided pre-approved reenlistments for top-performing Marines along with priority access to duty station and assignment options. This effort resulted in a 72% increase of first-term reenlistment submissions by top-performing Marines, with the average reenlistment approval accomplished in 24
to 48 hours – a fraction of the average reenlistment approval time. (MARADMIN 271/23)



STAFF NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER (SNCO) PROMOTION BOARD REALIGNMENT
To better sequence promotions, assignments, and reenlistments, enlisted promotion boards in FY 2024 will be realigned. This will result in reduced disruptions to unit cohesion and reduced uncertainty to Marines and families. (MARADMIN 453/22)



SPECIAL DUTY ASSIGNMENT (SDA) VOLUNTEER INCENTIVES
The SDA Volunteer Incentives provided Active and Reserve Component Marines who volunteer for Special Duty Assignment with their preferred duty stations. This incentive resulted in a 62% increase of volunteers minimizing disruption to Marines, families, and Fleet Marine Force units, while also reducing SDA school attrition. (MARADMIN 311/22)



CAREER INTERMISSION
PROGRAM (CIP)
CIP allows Marines to temporarily pause active duty service and later resume their careers without penalty to enable career flexibility and encourage retention of experienced, talented Marines. CIP payback was reduced by half to one month of obligated active service for each month of intermission. We will closely assess the program to ensure it balances the need to sustain our professional fighting force and prevent loss of skill and familiarization. (MARADMIN 241/22)



DIGITAL BOARDROOM 2.0 (DBR 2.0)
DBR 2.0 increases the functionality and accuracy of information presented to board members, safeguards data, and improves this critical talent management process. The Enlisted Career Retention and Reserve Aviation Boards were successfully executed using the DBR 2.0. As DBR 2.0 use is expanded, the Marine Corps will assess outcomes, cost and time savings, and professional depth and breadth of board members to benchmark with our legacy process. 



MARINEVIEW 360-DEGREE LEADERSHIP REVIEW
The Marine Corps launched the MarineView360 Leadership Review pilot, a program designed as a leadership development tool that leverages a Marine’s supervisors, peers, and subordinates to identify hidden strengths and areas for improvement. The MarineView360 pilot began with sitting commanders and will significantly expand to include officer and enlisted leaders in the future.



OFFICER PROMOTION
OPT-OUT
The Officer Promotion Opt-Out initiative allows certain Active and Reserve Component in-zone officer populations to opt-out of consideration for promotion once, without penalty, to pursue unconventional career experiences or formal education, to increase the flexibility in officer career paths. The potential for offering this same flexibility to enlisted Marines is being explored. (MARADMIN 011/22) 



RECRUITING STATION COMMANDING OFFICER (RSCO) SELECTION BOARD
Commissioned officers eligible for recruiting station command consideration were offered two opportunities to increase career flexibility: volunteer and request removal. This change allowed officers to volunteer for command, including those not scheduled for consideration; and to request removal from consideration for one year, without penalty, to complete a deployment, personal or professional obligation. (MARADMIN 311/22)


 









The Way Ahead


Reorienting and reconfiguring our human resources enterprise into a talent management system is a work in progress, but one that is well underway and accelerating. The actions we have taken, and those we will take, ensure we will remain the Nation’s premier expeditionary force-in-readiness within a rapidly evolving world.

The initiatives below, nested within four mutually supporting lines of effort, are representative of those under consideration for development and decision during 2023.









Talent Management Campaign Lines of Effort














01: Rebalance Recruiting and Retention
02: Optimize the Employment of Talent
03: Multiple Pathways to Career Success
04: Modern Talent Management Digital Tools



LOE1: Rebalance Recruiting and Retention
Rebalance recruiting and retention to accelerate the shift from our legacy, high turnover “recruit and replace” personnel model toward one characterized by a greater emphasis on investment in, and retention of, our most capable Marines.
The Way Ahead


QUALITY OF LEADERSHIP, QUALITY OF LIFE, MARINE FAMILIES
Reevaluating policies with renewed focus on Marines’ and their families’ needs, including high-quality barracks, chow halls, family housing, childcare center capacity, and sufficient options for pediatric care.  Success will require supportive and engaged leadership, resourcing, and willingness to adopt new strategies.

TARGETED MATURATION
OF THE FORCE
The retention of trained, experienced, and proven Marines capitalizes on training investments and stands to increase our combat power and readiness.  As we invest more intense training and education in Marines to prepare for more complex battlefields, we will retain more of our highest performing Marines.

ENLISTED CAREER DESIGNATION
We are preparing a pilot program for designation and indefinite end of active service.  This would align SNCO and officer retention practices, increase flexibility in assignments, and reduce administrative burden and uncertainty for SNCOs and their families.

LATERAL ENTRY
We are developing a pilot process to bring in exceptionally talented Americans to meet critical shortfalls in highly specialized skills.  In selected cases that benefit our warfighting readiness, these highly-qualified Americans will earn the title “Marine” and enter service at a rank appropriate for their education and experience.



LOE2: Optimize the Employment of Talent
Optimize the employment of talent to maximize our warfighting capabilities by increasing the effectiveness and transparency of the assignments process to better utilize and retain our most talented Marines.
The Way Ahead


MODERN TALENT MANAGEMENT TOOLS
The Marine Corps will implement a data-first strategy coupled with modernized talent management tools to reduce non-EAS attrition, and improve entry-level training performance, alignment of skills, and job satisfaction. The 3 tools in development are: the Marine Corps Occupational Specialty Matching (MCOSM) tool, the Tailored Adaptive Personality Assessment System (TAPAS), and the Retention Prediction Network (RPN).

HONE INCENTIVES
Based on empirical evidence, we will continue to refine our balance of monetary and non-monetary incentives to reward our most talented and committed Marines who volunteer for assignments beneficial to the institution. This includes eliminating non-essential permanent change of station moves and incentivizing lateral moves to increase retention of proven Marines.

CONTINUE TO MINIMIZE NON-ESSENTIAL PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION (PCS) MOVES
We will continue to increase local Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) moves and decrease non-essential PCS moves.  This shift increases unit cohesion, saves money, and reduces unnecessary strain on Marines and their families.

PROGRAM ENLISTED FOR REFORM
We are reexamining the manner in which we classify and assign recruits to specific MOSs.  The future system will more logically group MOSs and improve alignment of a recruit’s aptitude and desires with the needs of the Marine Corps.  We will also differentiate prerequisites for newly accessed Marines from experienced Marines who laterally move into a new MOS.

INCREASED RETURN ON INVESTMENT
Increased Return on Investment (ROI) – The service will explore revising personnel policies to enhance Service capability and return on investment, such as extending enlistment durations, offering conditions-based extensions, early reenlistment, and graduate education for SNCOs.



LOE3: Multiple Pathways To Career Success
As modern battlefields continue to demand more diversity of skills, expertise, and perspectives, we must adapt to accommodate multiple pathways to career success through career initiatives that account for evolving interests and personal development over the course of a Marine Corps career.
The Way Ahead


INCENTIVIZING LATERAL MOVES AND RETENTION
In FY24, we will present pre-approved lateral move options to talented Marines whose primary MOSs are already filled. We will also identify and remove barriers hindering lateral moves while exploiting incentives, such as fixed school dates and guaranteed follow-on orders, to help our most dedicated Marines fill gaps in critical fields.

ACTIVE AND RESERVE
PERMEABILITY
We seek to increase permeability between active and reserve components and take full advantage of opportunities for Total Force collaboration to increase our combat readiness.  Given the nature of legislative limitations on reserve employment, we will work closely with Congress to seek assistance in identifying specific opportunities for AC-RC permeability.

OFFICER TECHNICAL CAREER PATHS
Officers who obtain Marine Corps-funded technical skills at graduate-level schools bring unique capabilities and perspectives to the Service.  We will better capitalize on their expertise, increase our organizational performance, and maximize our return on investment in ways that are compatible with career success.



LOE4: Modern Talent Management Tools
Modernize talent management digital tools and data systems to synthesize personnel information and requirements across the force via a transparent, commander-focused, collaborative system to better align the individual abilities, skills, and aspirations of our Marines to our warfighting requirements.
The Way Ahead


MODERNIZE DATA MANAGEMENT
By implementing a data-first strategy focused on transforming, securing, and defending our personnel data, we will be able to promote, educate, develop, and retain our talent more effectively. We will begin by standardizing and aggregating our personnel data into a common data environment.

TALENT MANAGEMENT ENGAGEMENT PORTAL
We must field a transparent tool that integrates information to optimize assignments decisions. The platform will include a customer relationship management platform capable of advanced analytics and machine learning, as well as portals for Marines, monitors, and commands in a market-style assignment system.

AGILE TALENT EMPLOYMENT (GIG EAGLE)
This talent marketplace connects reserve personnel with specialized skill sets from across the Department of Defense with commands to fill immediate mission requirements. By breaking down barriers between branches and components, this program will allow Marine commands to unlock the talent within the RC and tactically apply their skills to support the mission at hand.
















Read The Update


""Marines depart recruit training having earned the title “Marine.” We must honor our commitment to them as they arrive in our operating forces expecting meaningful and challenging training, and a culture of professionalism, pride, mutual trust, and respect. I challenge leaders at all echelons to create an environment in which individual merit is fostered, identified, and rewarded.""
- Gen. David Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps.

Training and Education 2030




















""A warfighting capability is only as effective as the Marines employing it.""


— Gen. David Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps











The Problem


The current training and education system is not preparing the Marine Corps with the knowledge and range of skills required for the future operating environment.







Our Vision




MODERNIZATION
• Training in support of emerging concepts and mission sets will require new, converted, or repurposed training areas
• Reimagining training and education requires the application of information-age learning tools such as technology-enabled classrooms, digitized courseware, and robotic targets
• Modern learning methods and a student-centered approach requires a talented instructor cadre and yields high-caliber Marines


TRAINING REIMAGINED
• Create a globally connected live-virtual- constructive training environment that enables realistic training for all-domain warfare
• Expand integrated naval training to prepare Marines to seamlessly deploy and employ integrated fires in the naval and joint fight
• Encourage Marines to accelerate and expand their learning through incentivized skills progression


STANDARDS
• Rigorous and repeatable standards will continue to form the foundation for all training, education, and assessment
• We will hold-fast to our immutable high standards to continue building upon the legacy of the generations of Marines who came before us
• The title “Marine” is always earned and we will not compromise the standards that define what it is to become a Marine











Our Goal


The Marine Corps training and education ecosystem leverages technology, is data-driven, and effectively utilizes available resources to develop Marines who are cognitively agile, intuitive problem solvers, capable of making bold and consequential decisions in an uncertain environment.







 
How We Will Do It




DOCTRINE
Update doctrinal publications to align with Force Design 2030 and enable decisive maneuver in the future fight

Installations and Logistics 2030




















""We cannot continue to rely on the processes and procedures of yesterday and expect them to meet the challenges and threats of tomorrow.""


— Gen. David Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps











The Problem


The current logistical capabilities are under-resourced and do not meet the demands of our future force to succeed on future battlefields, and our installations are currently unable to provide the full range of essential services support, infrastructure, and trained personnel that directly link to the emerging requirements of the future force.







Our Vision







DOCTRINAL UPDATE: MCDP-4
ONGOING LOGISTICS EXPERIMENTATION
OPTIMIZING INSTALLATIONS




• The Marine Corps’ view of logistics is based on our common understanding of the nature of war, our role in the joint force, and our warfighting philosophy as described in Marine Corps Doctrinal Publication (MCDP) 1, Warfighting.
• This publication is a revision of the 1997 version of MCDP 4. We revised the doctrine because, “like war itself, our approach to warfighting must evolve.”
• This publication describes the role of logistics in a globally contested environment, where supply lines are stretched thin due to distance, and partners and allies have never been more important. Marines must be able to operate when logistics is contested, because increasingly persistent and global threats reinforce the need to leverage strategic- and operational-level logistics to support Marines.
(Download and read MCDP-4: Logistics)



• Logistics concept and structure do not always conform to traditional live force experimentation methods and sufficient Service-level experimentation capacity does not exist for all Force Design 2030 initiatives.
• The Service, through the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL), will leverage the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) and Supporting Establishment units and activities to conduct live, virtual, and/or constructive force experimentation of FD2030-related logistics concepts and organizational structure changes to inform further planning, refinement, investments, divestments, and decisions.
• This logistics focused experimentation effort will be nested within greater MCWI, Service Level Experimentation Campaign.



• The Marine Corps’ 25 installations provide the foundation for its readiness, forward presence, and ability to project power.
• The Marine Corps’ historical presence in the Pacific means its bases and stations in this region are especially significant and face unique challenges given the Department of Defense’s focus on China as the pacing challenge.
• As we imagine the future of logistics, we anticipate our installations will be required to make greater contributions to the sustainment network in support of the future force, particularly in forward locations.
• The Marine Corps organic industrial base (MCOIB), which includes our supply and maintenance depots, requires modernization to support rapid deployment and sustainment.















Our Goal


The Marine Corps installations and logistics ecosystem will succeed on tomorrow’s battlefields by employing a logistics enterprise fully integrated with the broader objectives of Force Design 2030, capable of supporting multi-domain and distributed operations in contested environments.







 
How We Will Do It




CREATE GLOBAL LOGISTICS AWARENESS
Findings from FD2030 planning and wargames indicate that to achieve resilient logistics networks, we need to view and understand our logistics resources differently than we have in the past. We will need tools to help commanders visualize logistics resources in space and time across the JLEnt. This will give us the ability to provide sustainment and distribution options based on threat, inventory position, and protection requirements.

DIVERSIFYDISTRIBUTION
Diversifying distribution refers to creating options in the methods, nodes, and modes available to the MCILE in staging, delivery, retrograde, and recovery of assets and logistics services to deployed forces. This objective addresses the need to capitalize on both existing and emerging distribution capabilities to support geographically dispersed forces in contested environments.

IMPROVESUSTAINMENT
Meeting sustainment requirements in contested areas will require Marines to plan for multiple methods of sustainment across each of the six functions of logistics. To provide this flexibility to forward forces, we will reimagine planning and execution for the logistics warfighting function and how it aligns to support the other warfighting functions. When feasible and appropriate, we will leverage demand reduction principles and technologies to reduce requirements and cumbersome stockpiles.

MAKE THE INSTALLATIONS READY FOR A CONTESTED ENVIRONMENT
As we adapt to the demands of all-domain battlefields, advancements in technology, and the challenges of peer and near-peer competition, our installations will play an even greater role supporting our warfighting concepts than in recent past. Smart, resilient, networked installations will provide stand-in forces with enhanced capabilities to recover quickly from attack, persist in contested spaces, and sustain distributed formations across multiple axes.

DEVELOP LOGISTICS PROFESSIONALS FOR 21ST CENTURY
There is no resource more precious or more critical to the continued success of our Corps than our Marines and civilians. Today, our senior logisticians have a wealth of combat and deployed experience that we must leverage to develop the knowledge and understanding of those who are just now entering our ranks. We have a unique opportunity to adapt their collective experience into future concepts and doctrine and will do so by incorporating past lessons and best practices into our training and education curricula.


 



 
Where can we use help from industry - and where are we already working together?







Autonomous Systems
Virtual Real-Time Reachback
Advanced Manufacturing
Alternative Energy
Leveraging Data



Think unmanned and uncrewed systems, as well as manned-unmanned teaming, particularly in transportation capabilities on the ground, at sea, under the sea, in the air, and in space.  The shift to autonomous systems has applicability in the public sector, as well, which is why there is such ripe opportunity for us to move forward rapidly.  For military application, unmanned and uncrewed systems provide huge opportunities for sustaining a force in the fight.  Although we must balance this with affordability and accountability.


The Marine Corps is already providing subject matter expertise over global distances with encrypted digital chats to discuss troubleshooting of weapon systems, and even conducting maintenance at echelons normally higher than the on-site mechanic is familiar with.  We are doing this with aviation and ground platforms.  This is currently occurring regularly between U.S. forces and Ukrainians who are learning to conduct maintenance on equipment sourced from the U.S.  Telemedicine for clinical services is becoming more acceptable.  Further growth in tele-surgery has resulted in specialized surgeons on one end assisting a general surgeon at the remote end, and even remote robotic surgery.  This is a very small field now, although the opportunities to expand this to the tactical edge will save lives, particularly in remote locations with limited casualty evacuation capability and availability.


3D, additive, and subtractive manufacturing reduces the time and distance for distribution of a repair part.  It increases responsiveness at the point and time of need.  Among many challenges are technical data rights and permissions, certification for tensile strength of weight bearing parts, and the impact on the manufacturing lines back at home.  Large-format, concrete 3D printing and other variations of construction 3D printing are also very applicable to support rapid deliberate military construction, as well as recovery of facilities after an attack.  The ability of a young Marine to conduct tactical level manufacturing on the front lines will save lives, particularly in a distributed, contested operating environment.


Alternative energy reduces the demand to transport liquid fuel over thousands of miles.  Each alternative energy option comes with new challenges in sustainability, safety, and form factor.  Regenerative energy is critical to ensure the force does not culminate during the fight or even before the fight begins.  Alternative energy is also directly related to our installations, where we are leaning forward with proofs of concept in alternative energy options to include solar and biomass steam turbines.  Partnership with local businesses and communities will enhance our base and local community energy resiliency, which is critical to mission assurance.


Leveraging data to enhance decision making to provide the right support, to the right place, at the right time.  We are looking to learn from commercial benchmarks that have shown us what is in the realm of the possible.  While not intending to advertise for specific brands, two benchmarks that are worth noting are Amazon and FedEx.
-The user interface that so many of us find to be second nature in the Amazon app to rapidly search multiple sources of supply and choose an item based on cost, delivery time, or condition, provides a model for how we want our Marines to be able to search quickly for options and make the right purchase to meet mission.  Behind that user interface is a large data pool connected to warehouses and distribution options, as well as the fiscal connections, to rapidly initiate supply responsiveness. 
-The second example is FedEx, which uses data science and machine learning to help make distribution more efficient.  FedEx uses data to reflect real time distribution across air and ground services, as well as the predictive analytics to anticipate impacts due to disruptive weather and even geopolitical shifts.  Further, these models provide options for rerouting that support centralized human decision making for risk mitigation.







 







Read The Report


""One broken link in a supply chain can result in an untethered force,"" said Lt. Gen. Edward Banta, Deputy Commandant for Installations and Logistics. ""A web mentality assures sustainment of the force, and can absorb disruption."" The new Marine Corps operating concept driving much of our future force structure, posture, and capabilities is the Concept for Stand-in Forces. These ""Stand-in Forces are small, low signature, mobile, relatively simple-to-maintain-and-sustain forces designed to operate across the competition continuum within a contested area.  They are the leading edge of a maritime defense-in-depth in order to intentionally disrupt the plans of a potential or actual adversary,"" according to the concept.

For decades, Lunga Recreation area and Reservoir was a favorite location for locals to relax, fish, camp, host command events, and even celebrate holidays like the fourth of July. In February 2012, after partially exposed mortar fins were found in the recreational area, Lunga was temporarily closed while Naval Facilities Engineering Command, and the Marine Corps explosives safety authority conducted an area survey to determine if the park was safe for continued use...

POC: MPO/TEL: (703) 784-9386/EMAIL: MPO@USMC.MIL//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. This MARADMIN announces changes to reference (a) which published the special duty assignment pay, assignment incentive pay, and volunteer supplemental incentive for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021.
2.  Effective 1 July 2023, the Marine Corps will discontinue the utilization, offering, and execution of the 6.8 percent discounted lump sum Assignment Incentive Pay (AIP) initiative.
3.  This is applicable to all newly assigned Marines who meet the eligibility criteria for AIP per reference (a).
4.  This change will have no impact to the lump sum Volunteer Supplemental Incentive (VSI) program.  Those Marines who volunteer for and are assigned to a special duty assignment, i.e., Recruiters, Drill Instructors, and Marine Security Guard Detachment Commanders, will still be eligible for lump sum VSI based upon assignment and months of commitment.
5.  All other provisions within reference (a) remain the same.
6.  Release authorized by Lieutenant General James F. Glynn, Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.//

4.  This change will have no impact to the lump sum Volunteer Supplemental Incentive (VSI) program.  Those Marines who volunteer for and are assigned to a special duty assignment, i.e., Recruiters, Drill Instructors, and Marine Security Guard Detachment Commanders, will still be eligible for lump sum VSI based upon assignment and months of commitment.
5.  All other provisions within reference (a) remain the same.
6.  Release authorized by Lieutenant General James F. Glynn, Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.//

POC/N. C. ROGERS/CAPT/DC MRA/MM/MMOA-1/TEL: 703-784-9277//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  Purpose.  The purpose of this MARADMIN is to provide information on the Judge Advocate Continuation Pay (JACP) Program for Fiscal Years 2023 (FY23) and 2024 (FY24).  Reference (a) provides the legal authority for the JACP Program.
2.  Background.  JACP is a special pay offered to judge advocates to retain high-performing and experienced counsel.  This program provides a proactive, short-term incentive for judge advocates in certain grades experiencing shortfalls.  JACP consists of a maximum of $110,000 per officer, paid in three phases throughout a judge advocate’s career as outlined in paragraph 5.  Contract lengths and monetary amounts are based on current and forecasted community shortfalls to improve the health of the judge advocate community and will be offered to Marine judge advocates who meet eligibility requirements outlined in paragraph 3.
3.  Eligibility Requirements.  To receive JACP, officers must meet the following non-waivable criteria during the effective dates of the FY23 JACP Program (1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023) or the FY24 JACP Program (1 October 2023 to 30 September 2024):
3.a.  Must be a captain or major;
3.b.  Must be in the active component;
3.c.  Must have completed all initial active duty service obligation incurred through the officer’s original commissioning program;
3.d.  Must be qualified and certified as a judge advocate as defined in Section 801 of Title 10 U.S. Code;
3.e.  Must have been selected for and accepted Career Designation (CD);
3.f.  Must have served more than four and fewer than 12 years of active commissioned service, to include time spent in the active reserve or on active duty operational support orders, as measured from the officer’s Armed Forces Active Duty Base Date (AFADBD), or Date of Rank First Commissioning (DORFC) in the case of prior-enlisted judge advocates; and,
3.g.  Must agree to continue serving as a Marine Corps judge advocate in the active component for the defined JACP contract term.
3.h.  Judge advocates who are uncertain of their eligibility status, or believe they are eligible despite a non-qualifying AFADBD, are encouraged to contact the JAD and MPP-30 POCs listed in this MARADMIN.
4.  Ineligible Categories
4.a.  Officers accessed into the Marine Corps judge advocate community through the Marine Corps-sponsored Funded Law Education Program under MCO 1524.1 are not eligible.  This criteria does not apply to otherwise eligible officers accessed into the Marine Corps judge advocate community through the Marine Corps-sponsored Excess Leave Program (ELP) under MCO 1524.1.  Officers accessed through the ELP are eligible after completing the attendant service obligation.
4.b.  Officers passed for promotion are not eligible for JACP.  Officers previously passed for promotion who have been subsequently selected for promotion, and meet remaining eligibility criteria, are eligible to apply for JACP.
5.  Payment Provisions.  The FY23 and FY24 JACP Programs consist of three phases (based on grade and years of active commissioned service as measured from the officer’s AFADBD, or DORFC in the case of prior-enlisted judge advocates), as outlined in paragraphs 5.a through 5.c.
5.a.  Phase I:  Captains upon acceptance of CD and completion of four and no more than seven years of active commissioned service.
5.a.1. Three annual payments of $10,000 (total of $30,000).
5.b.  Phase II:  Upon promotion to major and completion of 7 and no more than 10 years of active commissioned service.
5.b.1. Three annual payments:  $20,000 for the first installment and $10,000 for both the second and third installments (total of $40,000).
5.b.2. Any Phase I obligated service must be fulfilled prior to the Phase II contract start date. 
5.c.  Phase III:  Majors, including lieutenant colonel-selects, upon completion of 10 and no more than 12 years of active commissioned service.
5.c.1. Three annual payments:  $20,000 for the first installment and $10,000 for both the second and third installments (total of $40,000).
5.c.2. Any Phase II obligated service must be fulfilled prior to the Phase III contract start date.
5.d.  Judge advocates will be paid the first installment no later than 30 days after the contract start date as defined in the following paragraph.  Second and third installment payments will be made on the anniversary date of the officer’s JACP contract start date.
5.e.  Contract start date is defined as the date the application is approved by CMC (MPP-30) or the completion of any existing service obligation that cannot run concurrently with JACP service obligation per reference (c), whichever occurs later.
6.  Active Duty Service Obligation.  Officers approved for JACP will incur an active duty service obligation of three years from the contract start date.
6.a.  No JACP payments will be issued prior to the commencement of the officer’s JACP service obligation.
6.b.  JACP service obligation shall be served consecutively with existing service obligations except where reference (c) authorizes concurrent service obligations.
6.c.  Judge advocates with existing service obligations who are approved for JACP may request to withdraw from JACP participation no less than 90 days prior to their contract start date.  Such requests will be submitted via administrative action form to JAD@usmc.mil.
6.d.  Judge advocates receiving JACP who are offered continuation on active duty after being twice passed for promotion may elect to refuse continuation on active duty but may be subject to the recoupment of any unearned JACP payments if they are separated prior to fulfilling their JACP service obligation, per paragraph 7.a of this message.
6.e.  Submission of incomplete application packages, packages requiring resubmission, or submission of excess information beyond the requirements may result in a processing delay and could result in a delay of contract start date.
6.f.  An officer may only be released from their JACP service obligation upon approval by CMC (MP).
7.  Recoupment and Repayment Provisions
7.a.  Termination and Repayment Required.  Judge advocates who are unable to complete the service obligation specified in the JACP agreement may be subject to termination of any unpaid bonus amount and repayment of the unearned portion of prepaid amounts on a pro-rated basis in the following circumstances:
7.a.1. Voluntary or involuntary separation from active duty or discharge within the related contract extension time;
7.a.2. Loss of certification under Article 27(b), UCMJ, or suspension from practice as a judge advocate for one year or longer, subsequent to acceptance of JACP;
7.a.3. Medical incapacitation or physical disability resulting from misconduct, gross negligence, or incurred during a period of unauthorized absence;
7.a.4. Separation or dismissal for cause, resignation in lieu of court martial, or resignation in lieu of processing for administrative separation; or
7.a.5. Involuntary separation from military service by operation of law, or involuntary separation by operation of military service or policy.
7.b.  Recoupment and Repayment Not Required.  Officers will not be required to repay the unearned portion of prepaid amounts of JACP, and any remaining JACP service obligation will be terminated under the following circumstances:

GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  Purpose.  The purpose of this MARADMIN is to provide information on the Judge Advocate Continuation Pay (JACP) Program for Fiscal Years 2023 (FY23) and 2024 (FY24).  Reference (a) provides the legal authority for the JACP Program.
2.  Background.  JACP is a special pay offered to judge advocates to retain high-performing and experienced counsel.  This program provides a proactive, short-term incentive for judge advocates in certain grades experiencing shortfalls.  JACP consists of a maximum of $110,000 per officer, paid in three phases throughout a judge advocate’s career as outlined in paragraph 5.  Contract lengths and monetary amounts are based on current and forecasted community shortfalls to improve the health of the judge advocate community and will be offered to Marine judge advocates who meet eligibility requirements outlined in paragraph 3.
3.  Eligibility Requirements.  To receive JACP, officers must meet the following non-waivable criteria during the effective dates of the FY23 JACP Program (1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023) or the FY24 JACP Program (1 October 2023 to 30 September 2024):
3.a.  Must be a captain or major;
3.b.  Must be in the active component;
3.c.  Must have completed all initial active duty service obligation incurred through the officer’s original commissioning program;
3.d.  Must be qualified and certified as a judge advocate as defined in Section 801 of Title 10 U.S. Code;
3.e.  Must have been selected for and accepted Career Designation (CD);
3.f.  Must have served more than four and fewer than 12 years of active commissioned service, to include time spent in the active reserve or on active duty operational support orders, as measured from the officer’s Armed Forces Active Duty Base Date (AFADBD), or Date of Rank First Commissioning (DORFC) in the case of prior-enlisted judge advocates; and,
3.g.  Must agree to continue serving as a Marine Corps judge advocate in the active component for the defined JACP contract term.
3.h.  Judge advocates who are uncertain of their eligibility status, or believe they are eligible despite a non-qualifying AFADBD, are encouraged to contact the JAD and MPP-30 POCs listed in this MARADMIN.
4.  Ineligible Categories
4.a.  Officers accessed into the Marine Corps judge advocate community through the Marine Corps-sponsored Funded Law Education Program under MCO 1524.1 are not eligible.  This criteria does not apply to otherwise eligible officers accessed into the Marine Corps judge advocate community through the Marine Corps-sponsored Excess Leave Program (ELP) under MCO 1524.1.  Officers accessed through the ELP are eligible after completing the attendant service obligation.
4.b.  Officers passed for promotion are not eligible for JACP.  Officers previously passed for promotion who have been subsequently selected for promotion, and meet remaining eligibility criteria, are eligible to apply for JACP.
5.  Payment Provisions.  The FY23 and FY24 JACP Programs consist of three phases (based on grade and years of active commissioned service as measured from the officer’s AFADBD, or DORFC in the case of prior-enlisted judge advocates), as outlined in paragraphs 5.a through 5.c.
5.a.  Phase I:  Captains upon acceptance of CD and completion of four and no more than seven years of active commissioned service.
5.a.1. Three annual payments of $10,000 (total of $30,000).
5.b.  Phase II:  Upon promotion to major and completion of 7 and no more than 10 years of active commissioned service.
5.b.1. Three annual payments:  $20,000 for the first installment and $10,000 for both the second and third installments (total of $40,000).
5.b.2. Any Phase I obligated service must be fulfilled prior to the Phase II contract start date. 
5.c.  Phase III:  Majors, including lieutenant colonel-selects, upon completion of 10 and no more than 12 years of active commissioned service.
5.c.1. Three annual payments:  $20,000 for the first installment and $10,000 for both the second and third installments (total of $40,000).
5.c.2. Any Phase II obligated service must be fulfilled prior to the Phase III contract start date.
5.d.  Judge advocates will be paid the first installment no later than 30 days after the contract start date as defined in the following paragraph.  Second and third installment payments will be made on the anniversary date of the officer’s JACP contract start date.
5.e.  Contract start date is defined as the date the application is approved by CMC (MPP-30) or the completion of any existing service obligation that cannot run concurrently with JACP service obligation per reference (c), whichever occurs later.
6.  Active Duty Service Obligation.  Officers approved for JACP will incur an active duty service obligation of three years from the contract start date.
6.a.  No JACP payments will be issued prior to the commencement of the officer’s JACP service obligation.
6.b.  JACP service obligation shall be served consecutively with existing service obligations except where reference (c) authorizes concurrent service obligations.
6.c.  Judge advocates with existing service obligations who are approved for JACP may request to withdraw from JACP participation no less than 90 days prior to their contract start date.  Such requests will be submitted via administrative action form to JAD@usmc.mil.
6.d.  Judge advocates receiving JACP who are offered continuation on active duty after being twice passed for promotion may elect to refuse continuation on active duty but may be subject to the recoupment of any unearned JACP payments if they are separated prior to fulfilling their JACP service obligation, per paragraph 7.a of this message.
6.e.  Submission of incomplete application packages, packages requiring resubmission, or submission of excess information beyond the requirements may result in a processing delay and could result in a delay of contract start date.
6.f.  An officer may only be released from their JACP service obligation upon approval by CMC (MP).
7.  Recoupment and Repayment Provisions
7.a.  Termination and Repayment Required.  Judge advocates who are unable to complete the service obligation specified in the JACP agreement may be subject to termination of any unpaid bonus amount and repayment of the unearned portion of prepaid amounts on a pro-rated basis in the following circumstances:
7.a.1. Voluntary or involuntary separation from active duty or discharge within the related contract extension time;

POC/MANPOWER MILITARY POLICY (MPO)/EMAIL: MPO@USMC.MIL/ TEL: (703) 784-9360//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  Purpose.  To provide notification of the change in reference (a), effective 1 July 2023, the criteria used to determine eligibility for BNA will change from 130 percent of Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG) to 150 percent of FPG.  There are no changes in the administrative application process for Marines to apply for BNA.
2.  Background.  The establishment of the basic needs allowance was implemented into law with the enactment of reference (d).  This includes the provisions and specifications of references (e) and (f) that the BNA program provides a monthly allowance for service members who voluntarily apply and whose Gross Household Income (GHI) and household size place them below 150 percent of Federal Poverty Guideline (FPG) for their geographical location.
3.  Definitions
3.a.  FPG.  Annually published income measure issued by Health and Human Services (HHS) for a specific number of household members and a geographical location.
3.b.  GHI.  Includes all income, i.e., basic pay, Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) and Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS).  In addition to any income derived from each member of the household from any source, including government food assistance programs.
3.c.  Household.  An active-duty service member and any dependents of the members enrolled in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), regardless of those dependents’ locations.
4.  Action.  Effective immediately, Marines seeking to receive BNA may voluntarily apply by submitting a signed and completed application in accordance with reference (g).
5.  Eligibility.  Active-duty service members with dependents enrolled in DEERS are eligible for BNA and may be certified if:
5.a.  They have completed initial entry training (IET).
5.b.  Their GHI during the calendar year preceding the year of application did not exceed 150 percent of the FPG as published for their location and number of individuals in their household.
6.  BNA Screening.  All Marines will be screened for BNA eligibility.  Marines who are potentially identified as being eligible for BNA at 150 percent will be notified via Marine On-Line (MOL) as well as by their S-1 offices and commanding officers. 
7.  Notification and Eligibility.  Notification and eligibility criteria per reference (g) remains unchanged.
8.  Submitting BNA applications.  The process of applying for BNA is unchanged.  Marines will use MOL, MyEPAR, Create New EPAR Record, Subject:  Basic Needs Allowance (BNA) to submit the BNA application along with supporting documentation.  The BNA application, BNA Eligibility and Allowance Calculator, BNA Page 11 remarks example and other resources are located and available within Subject Forms located with the MOL EPAR.
9.  Coordinating Instructions
9.a.  To ensure accuracy in determining BNA eligibility, Marines and commanders are highly encouraged to utilize the BNA Eligibility and Allowance Calculator tool.

POC/MANPOWER MILITARY POLICY (MPO)/EMAIL: MPO@USMC.MIL/ TEL: (703) 784-9360//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  Purpose.  To provide notification of the change in reference (a), effective 1 July 2023, the criteria used to determine eligibility for BNA will change from 130 percent of Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG) to 150 percent of FPG.  There are no changes in the administrative application process for Marines to apply for BNA.
2.  Background.  The establishment of the basic needs allowance was implemented into law with the enactment of reference (d).  This includes the provisions and specifications of references (e) and (f) that the BNA program provides a monthly allowance for service members who voluntarily apply and whose Gross Household Income (GHI) and household size place them below 150 percent of Federal Poverty Guideline (FPG) for their geographical location.
3.  Definitions
3.a.  FPG.  Annually published income measure issued by Health and Human Services (HHS) for a specific number of household members and a geographical location.
3.b.  GHI.  Includes all income, i.e., basic pay, Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) and Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS).  In addition to any income derived from each member of the household from any source, including government food assistance programs.
3.c.  Household.  An active-duty service member and any dependents of the members enrolled in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), regardless of those dependents’ locations.
4.  Action.  Effective immediately, Marines seeking to receive BNA may voluntarily apply by submitting a signed and completed application in accordance with reference (g).
5.  Eligibility.  Active-duty service members with dependents enrolled in DEERS are eligible for BNA and may be certified if:
5.a.  They have completed initial entry training (IET).
5.b.  Their GHI during the calendar year preceding the year of application did not exceed 150 percent of the FPG as published for their location and number of individuals in their household.
6.  BNA Screening.  All Marines will be screened for BNA eligibility.  Marines who are potentially identified as being eligible for BNA at 150 percent will be notified via Marine On-Line (MOL) as well as by their S-1 offices and commanding officers. 
7.  Notification and Eligibility.  Notification and eligibility criteria per reference (g) remains unchanged.
8.  Submitting BNA applications.  The process of applying for BNA is unchanged.  Marines will use MOL, MyEPAR, Create New EPAR Record, Subject:  Basic Needs Allowance (BNA) to submit the BNA application along with supporting documentation.  The BNA application, BNA Eligibility and Allowance Calculator, BNA Page 11 remarks example and other resources are located and available within Subject Forms located with the MOL EPAR.
9.  Coordinating Instructions
9.a.  To ensure accuracy in determining BNA eligibility, Marines and commanders are highly encouraged to utilize the BNA Eligibility and Allowance Calculator tool.
9.b.  Marines in receipt of BNA are responsible for reporting any changes in GHI or family size to their S-1 office.  Marines who are receiving BNA and become ineligible due to their GHI surpassing 150 percent of the previous year FPG based on their household size, will have their BNA terminated no later than 60 days after date of ineligibility. For example, a Marine is promoted and becomes ineligible for BNA due to the pay grade increase, the Marine will continue to receive BNA for 60 days after the date of promotion.
9.c.  Marines in receipt of BNA must annually resubmit an updated signed application along with substantiating documentation via MOL EPAR.
10.  Impact on receipt of BNA.  Marines should be aware that receipt of BNA may impact eligibility for Federal assistance food programs such as subsidized school lunch programs, WIC, and SNAP.
11.  BNA Tools.  To assist commanders and Marines, several BNA tools are available at https:(slash)(slash)www.manpower.usmc.mil/webcenter/portal/MPO/pages_compensation/ and within the MOL EPAR module.  Available tools include, BNA Application Template, BNA Allowance Calculator, BNA Infographics, BNA Monthly Reports template, and page 11 template.
12.  BNA is applicable to all active duty Marines as defined in Section 101 of Title 37, U.S.C.
13.  Point of Contact.  All questions concerning BNA should be directed to the members administration section and local IPAC prior to contacting Manpower Military Policy (MPO).
14.  Release authorized by Lieutenant General James F. Glynn, Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.//

REF/B/MCO 3850.1J//
REF/C/SIPR AMHS DTG 141406Z FEB 20/-/20200214//
REF/D/NAVMC 11324//
NARR/REF A IS THE MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTIES MANUAL. REF B IS POLICY AND GUIDANCE FOR COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (CI) AND HUMAN INTELLIGENCE (HUMINT) ACTIVITIES. REF (C) IS MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTY (MOS) 0211 COUNTERINTELLIGENCE/HUMAN INTELLIGENCE SPECIALIST LATERAL MOVE PROCESS. REF (D) IS NAVY AND MARINE CORPS FORM, CI/HUMINT LATERAL MOVE SCREENING CHECKLIST.
POC/DC I/WESLEY A BARNEY/MSGT/0211 OCCUAPTIONAL FIELD SPECIALIST/571-256-9322/DSN 312-256-9322/EMAIL: WESLEY.A.BARNEY@USMC.MIL/EMAIL: CIHUMINT_LATMOVE@USMC.MIL//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. Purpose.  This MARADMIN is to solicit qualified Marines to apply for a lateral move into primary MOS 0211, CI/HUMINT Specialist for Fiscal Year 2024. Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA) has categorized the 0211 MOS as a critical career force skill shortage. The demand for qualified Marines to lateral move to this MOS will remain high for the foreseeable future.
2. Background. CI/HUMINT Specialists perform sensitive and complex intelligence operations in support of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) during garrison and deployed operations.  They identify threats posed by hostile intelligence organizations or persons engaged in espionage, sabotage, subversion, or terrorism. Marines also collect information of intelligence value through interrogation, debriefing, screening, and/or liaison operations.  They can deploy with a MAGTF, other Services, and interagency partners to protect personnel, property, and national security information. 
2.a. CI/HUMINT Marines directly contribute to the success of the Marine Corps mission. While the requisite technical and operational skills are learned through training, there are certain innate qualities which CI/HUMINT Specialists must possess.  CI/HUMINT Marines must have outstanding communication skills which enable them to interact with a wide variety of people under any circumstance.  Intellect, flexibility, creativity, and diverse cultural experience are invaluable traits of CI/HUMINT Marines.  The MOS requires a layered depth of character, morality, and maturity, and mission success relies heavily on interpersonal skills.  Accordingly, Marines who apply for lateral move must have first proven themselves as high-quality Marines. 
2.b. CI/HUMINT Marines undergo extensive training, operating both independently and as small teams in support of MAGTF/Joint Forces.  In addition to entry level training and specialized follow-on intelligence courses, CI/HUMINT Marines have the opportunity to attend survival and airborne training, advanced driving and shooting courses, and other training courses related to tactical, operational, and strategic operations.
2.c. CI/HUMINT Marines serve in both the Active and Reserve Components. During a career, they may be assigned to the Marine Corps Fleet Marine Force, Supporting Establishment, Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command, Defense Intelligence Agency, Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Combatant Commands, and other unique billets.
2.d. CI/HUMINT lateral move applicants must meet the following criteria:
2.d.1. Must be a volunteer Corporal or Sergeant of any MOS. Exceptionally qualified Lance Corporals and Staff Sergeants may be screened for lateral move on a case-by-case basis.
2.d.2. Must be a United States (U.S.) citizen.
2.d.3. Must possess a minimum General Technical score of 105, OR a minimum Clerical score of 105, OR a minimum Armed Forces Qualification Test score of 55.
2.d.4. Must meet sensitive compartmented information eligibility guidelines based on a single scope background investigation/T5 investigation.
2.d.5. Must be 21 years of age or older prior to graduation from the MAGTF CI/HUMINT Course.
2.d.6. Must be willing to submit to a Counterintelligence-scope Polygraph Examination.
2.d.7. Must possess a valid U.S. driver's license.
2.d.8. Must be worldwide deployable when approved for lateral move.
2.d.9. Must have 60 months obligated service upon lateral move approval.
2.e. CI/HUMINT Specialists serve a critical role within the Reserve Component (RC).  To be eligible for PMOS 0211 in the RC, Marines must meet the following criteria:
2.e.1. Selected Marine Corps Reserve (SMCR). Marines must affiliate with or be a current member of an SMCR Unit.
2.e.2. Individual Mobilization Augmentee. Marines must be affiliated with a SMCR unit.
2.e.3. Individual Ready Reserve. Marines must be discharged from the Active Component or Selected Reserve under honorable conditions.
2.e.4. Direct Affiliation Program (DAP). Active Component or Active Reserve Marines can apply for lateral move into PMOS 0211 within the RC via the DAP. They must be released under honorable conditions.
2.e.5. RC Marines must sign a Statement of Understanding accepting the requirements and conduct of Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders to attend PMOS 0211 entry level training.
2.e.6. MARADMIN 279/20 and MARADMIN 470/22 provides additional Reserve-related lateral move information.
2.e.7. Marines approved for lateral move into the 0211 MOS may rate a substantial selective retention bonus (SRB). For example, a qualified Sergeant who lateral moves into PMOS 0211 and agrees to serve 72-months will qualify for both a $65,000 MOS-specific bonus and the $40,000 kicker for a total of $105,000.  Upon successful completion of MOS training and subsequent award of PMOS 0211, bonus payment will be paid based upon the SRB amount authorized at the time of reenlistment.
3. Execution. Interested Marines are encouraged to visit the Marine Corps PMOS 0211 website at https:(slash)(slash)www.intelligence.marines.mil/careers to obtain additional information on the MOS. They should contact their Career Planner or Prior Service Recruiter to initiate the lateral move process. Eligible Marines must complete reference (d) which includes a screening and suitability assessment process. Marines are required to be interviewed by a panel of only Marine Corps CI/HUMINT personnel and receive a lateral move recommendation. 
3.a. Marines approved for lateral move by M&RA will execute PCS or permanent change of assignment orders to Marine Detachment Dam Neck for the MAGTF CI/HUMINT Course, Marine Corps Intelligence Schools located in Virginia Beach, VA.

REF/B/MCO 3850.1J//
REF/C/SIPR AMHS DTG 141406Z FEB 20/-/20200214//
REF/D/NAVMC 11324//
NARR/REF A IS THE MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTIES MANUAL. REF B IS POLICY AND GUIDANCE FOR COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (CI) AND HUMAN INTELLIGENCE (HUMINT) ACTIVITIES. REF (C) IS MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTY (MOS) 0211 COUNTERINTELLIGENCE/HUMAN INTELLIGENCE SPECIALIST LATERAL MOVE PROCESS. REF (D) IS NAVY AND MARINE CORPS FORM, CI/HUMINT LATERAL MOVE SCREENING CHECKLIST.
POC/DC I/WESLEY A BARNEY/MSGT/0211 OCCUAPTIONAL FIELD SPECIALIST/571-256-9322/DSN 312-256-9322/EMAIL: WESLEY.A.BARNEY@USMC.MIL/EMAIL: CIHUMINT_LATMOVE@USMC.MIL//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. Purpose.  This MARADMIN is to solicit qualified Marines to apply for a lateral move into primary MOS 0211, CI/HUMINT Specialist for Fiscal Year 2024. Manpower and Reserve Affairs (M&RA) has categorized the 0211 MOS as a critical career force skill shortage. The demand for qualified Marines to lateral move to this MOS will remain high for the foreseeable future.
2. Background. CI/HUMINT Specialists perform sensitive and complex intelligence operations in support of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) during garrison and deployed operations.  They identify threats posed by hostile intelligence organizations or persons engaged in espionage, sabotage, subversion, or terrorism. Marines also collect information of intelligence value through interrogation, debriefing, screening, and/or liaison operations.  They can deploy with a MAGTF, other Services, and interagency partners to protect personnel, property, and national security information. 
2.a. CI/HUMINT Marines directly contribute to the success of the Marine Corps mission. While the requisite technical and operational skills are learned through training, there are certain innate qualities which CI/HUMINT Specialists must possess.  CI/HUMINT Marines must have outstanding communication skills which enable them to interact with a wide variety of people under any circumstance.  Intellect, flexibility, creativity, and diverse cultural experience are invaluable traits of CI/HUMINT Marines.  The MOS requires a layered depth of character, morality, and maturity, and mission success relies heavily on interpersonal skills.  Accordingly, Marines who apply for lateral move must have first proven themselves as high-quality Marines. 
2.b. CI/HUMINT Marines undergo extensive training, operating both independently and as small teams in support of MAGTF/Joint Forces.  In addition to entry level training and specialized follow-on intelligence courses, CI/HUMINT Marines have the opportunity to attend survival and airborne training, advanced driving and shooting courses, and other training courses related to tactical, operational, and strategic operations.
2.c. CI/HUMINT Marines serve in both the Active and Reserve Components. During a career, they may be assigned to the Marine Corps Fleet Marine Force, Supporting Establishment, Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command, Defense Intelligence Agency, Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Combatant Commands, and other unique billets.
2.d. CI/HUMINT lateral move applicants must meet the following criteria:
2.d.1. Must be a volunteer Corporal or Sergeant of any MOS. Exceptionally qualified Lance Corporals and Staff Sergeants may be screened for lateral move on a case-by-case basis.
2.d.2. Must be a United States (U.S.) citizen.
2.d.3. Must possess a minimum General Technical score of 105, OR a minimum Clerical score of 105, OR a minimum Armed Forces Qualification Test score of 55.
2.d.4. Must meet sensitive compartmented information eligibility guidelines based on a single scope background investigation/T5 investigation.
2.d.5. Must be 21 years of age or older prior to graduation from the MAGTF CI/HUMINT Course.
2.d.6. Must be willing to submit to a Counterintelligence-scope Polygraph Examination.
2.d.7. Must possess a valid U.S. driver's license.
2.d.8. Must be worldwide deployable when approved for lateral move.
2.d.9. Must have 60 months obligated service upon lateral move approval.
2.e. CI/HUMINT Specialists serve a critical role within the Reserve Component (RC).  To be eligible for PMOS 0211 in the RC, Marines must meet the following criteria:
2.e.1. Selected Marine Corps Reserve (SMCR). Marines must affiliate with or be a current member of an SMCR Unit.
2.e.2. Individual Mobilization Augmentee. Marines must be affiliated with a SMCR unit.
2.e.3. Individual Ready Reserve. Marines must be discharged from the Active Component or Selected Reserve under honorable conditions.
2.e.4. Direct Affiliation Program (DAP). Active Component or Active Reserve Marines can apply for lateral move into PMOS 0211 within the RC via the DAP. They must be released under honorable conditions.
2.e.5. RC Marines must sign a Statement of Understanding accepting the requirements and conduct of Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders to attend PMOS 0211 entry level training.
2.e.6. MARADMIN 279/20 and MARADMIN 470/22 provides additional Reserve-related lateral move information.
2.e.7. Marines approved for lateral move into the 0211 MOS may rate a substantial selective retention bonus (SRB). For example, a qualified Sergeant who lateral moves into PMOS 0211 and agrees to serve 72-months will qualify for both a $65,000 MOS-specific bonus and the $40,000 kicker for a total of $105,000.  Upon successful completion of MOS training and subsequent award of PMOS 0211, bonus payment will be paid based upon the SRB amount authorized at the time of reenlistment.
3. Execution. Interested Marines are encouraged to visit the Marine Corps PMOS 0211 website at https:(slash)(slash)www.intelligence.marines.mil/careers to obtain additional information on the MOS. They should contact their Career Planner or Prior Service Recruiter to initiate the lateral move process. Eligible Marines must complete reference (d) which includes a screening and suitability assessment process. Marines are required to be interviewed by a panel of only Marine Corps CI/HUMINT personnel and receive a lateral move recommendation. 
3.a. Marines approved for lateral move by M&RA will execute PCS or permanent change of assignment orders to Marine Detachment Dam Neck for the MAGTF CI/HUMINT Course, Marine Corps Intelligence Schools located in Virginia Beach, VA.
3.b. This MARADMIN is applicable to the Total Force.
4. Direct all question to MARADMIN POC.
5. Release authorized by LtGen Mathew G. Glavy, Headquarters Marine Corps, Deputy Commandant for Information.//

RENTAL CAR REIMBURSEMENT POLICY CLARIFICATION FOR RESERVE MARINES

GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  Purpose.  To provide policy clarification on rental car reimbursement for Reserve Marines performing annual training in accordance with references (a) and (b).
2.  Background.  Policy guidance found on page 7-13 of reference (b) presented an example/scenario which may be interpreted prescriptively by commanders, thereby limiting their discretion to authorize the reimbursement of rental cars when in the best interest of the command.  The Marine Corps Reserve Policy Board recommended interim policy clarification be published in advance of being incorporated into the next revision of reference (b).
3.  Reserve Marines ordered to annual training shall normally be billeted and subsist aboard the station to which the unit is assigned for training.  In cases where a Reserve Marine is not billeted aboard the same station (installation) to which the unit is assigned for training, (due to non-availability of billeting, not due to individual preference) the unit is responsible for providing transportation or authorizing reimbursement for transportation from the billeting location to the training location.  Accordingly, commanders may authorize the reimbursement of rental cars when it is in the best interest of the command to do so.  Such reimbursement is unit funded and is therefore at the unit commander’s discretion to authorize reimbursement or to provide alternate means of transportation.
4.  This MARADMIN is applicable to the Reserve Component.

RESERVE COMPONENT TELECOMMUTE POLICY UPDATE

REF/A/MSGID: DOC/CMC/YMD: 20180315//
REF/B/MSGID: DOC/DOD/YMD: 20200407//
REF/C/MSGID: DOC/DON/YMD: 20190211//
NARR/REFERENCE (A) IS MARINE CORPS ORDER 1001R.1L W/CH-1, MARINE CORPS RESERVE ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT MANUAL. REFERENCE (B) IS DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INSTRUCTION 1035.01 INCORPORATING CHANGE 1, TELEWORK POLICY. REFERENCE (C) SECRETARY OF THE NAVY INSTRUCTION 12271.1 CH-1, DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY TELEWORK POLICY.//
POC/J. SHAO/MAJ/CMC(RAP-1)/TEL: (703)784-9138/EMAIL: RAP@USMC.MIL//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  Purpose.  To update service guidance for Reserve Component telecommute policy as contained in reference (a) in alignment with references (b) and (c).
2.  Background.  Telecommuting allows unit commanders the flexibility to assign Additional Training Periods (ATPs) and Readiness Management Periods (RMPs) to members of their command to accomplish assigned tasks away from the Home Training Center/Reserve Training Center (HTC/RTC).  Telecommuting allows work products to be more conveniently and expeditiously completed without the necessity of orders or expending travel funds.  It is simply another tool designed to facilitate mission accomplishment.  The Marine Corps temporarily authorized regular Inactive Duty Training (IDT) periods to be performed in a telecommute status during the public health emergency due to coronavirus.  This temporary authority expired when the declaration of national emergency was rescinded on 10 April 2023.
3.  Policy.  Per reference (a), Commanders and Operational Sponsors may authorize Reserve Marines to perform ATPs and RMPs in telecommute status, on a case-by-case basis.  This authority is hereby expanded to include the performance of regular IDTs in a telecommute status.  No more than 48 regular IDTs may be performed via telecommute or in-person in a fiscal year by any single Marine.  All other provisions, requirements, and restrictions pertaining to telecommuting as stipulated in reference (a), chapter 7, section 3 remain in effect.  Commanders and Operational Sponsors may authorize, limit, or prohibit the use of telecommuting, at their discretion.
4.  This MARADMIN will take effect upon publication and remain in place until incorporated into reference (a) or cancelled by a future MARADMIN.
5.  This MARADMIN is applicable to the Reserve Component.

4.  Delay of Promotion
4.a.  Commanding Officer Determination.  Per refs (b) and (g), if the respective commanding officer determines that an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for promotion, the promotion shall not be effected.  This includes the physical examination requirement for reserve officers per section 10206 of ref (a).  The officer shall be given written notice of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the appointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the notice shall be given as soon as practicable.  CMC (MMPR-1) must also be notified prior to the effective date of the appointment so that the promotion will not be effected in Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and administrative action can be initiated.  Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain guidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation.
4.b.  Adverse Screening Process.  Before the release of this promotion authority, all officers were screened for adverse or potentially adverse information.  The names of those officers with records identified during the adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially adverse information were removed from the promotion authority MARADMIN.  Those officers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC (JPL).
5.  Retirement and Transfer.  Officers considering voluntary retirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to acceptance of promotion.  An officer's selection for promotion carries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with augmentation into the regular component.
6.  Accepting and Declining Promotion.  Any regular or reserve officer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have accepted such promotion on the effective date contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and allowances in the grade to which promoted).  To decline a promotion, an officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC (MMPR-1) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their promotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the next higher grade.  Any statement or action by the officer which signals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their right to decline.
7.  For Marine officer promotion matters call Comm (703)784-9706 or DSN 278-9706.  Email inquiries may be submitted via the Promotion Branch's internet web page at www.Marines.mil.  Email address is officerpromotions@usmc.mil.

10.  Delay of Promotion
10.a.  Commanding Officer Determination.  Per refs (b) and (h), if the respective commanding officer determines that an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for promotion, the promotion shall not be effected.  This includes the physical examination requirement per section 10206 of ref (a).  The officer shall be given written notice of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the appointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the notice shall be given as soon as practicable.  CMC (MMPR-1) must also be notified prior to the effective date of the appointment so that the promotion will not be effected in Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and administrative action can be initiated.  Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain guidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation.
10.b.  Adverse Screening Process.  Before the release of this promotion authority, all officers were screened for adverse or potentially adverse information.  The names of those officers with records identified during the adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially adverse information were removed from the promotion authority MARADMIN.  Those officers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC (JPL).
11.  Retirement and Transfer.  Officers considering voluntary retirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to acceptance of promotion.  An officer's selection for promotion carries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with augmentation into the regular component.
12.  Accepting and Declining Promotion.  Any regular or reserve officer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have accepted such promotion on the effective date contained in paragraphs 3 through 9 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and allowances in the grade to which promoted).  To decline a promotion, an officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC (MMPR-1) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their promotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the next higher grade.  Any statement or action by the officer which signals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their right to decline.
13.  The following FY23 promotions are projected for August 2023 and are subject to change.  Promotions from the remaining FY23 boards will be promulgated based on vacancy determination.

GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  AUTHORITY.  Refs (a) through (i) regulate all Marine Corps officer promotions.  This MARADMIN is the authority for commanding officers to effect promotions.  Per the refs, an officer's promotion may not be effected until that officer's name appears on a promotion MARADMIN or CMC message.  Appropriate commissions will be mailed to parent commands under separate cover.  Expect 4-6 weeks for delivery.  The commission is not the legal authority to promote and is not required to effect the promotion.  For the purposes of conducting a promotion ceremony, sample commissions and the oath of office can be found in chapter 6 of ref (b) or the Officer Promotion Branch's homepage at www.Marines.mil.  Under ""Marines/Career,"" click on ""Promotions.""  Click on ""Officer Promotions,"" look under the ""Reference"" tab on the right side of the page.
2.  All officers promoted to the rank of colonel must follow the requirements directed by MCO 5750.1H, page 2-5, for submissions of personal information to the Director of Marine Corps History Division (HRD).  See paragraph 16 for mailing address and POC information.
3.  Under the provisions of section 624 of ref (a) and ref (c), the Secretary of the Navy, acting for the President of the United States, hereby authorizes the promotion of the following named regular officer(s) to the grade indicated.  Rank, pay and allowances are effective from 1 July 2023.

10.  Delay of Promotion
10.a.  Commanding Officer Determination.  Per refs (b) and (h), if the respective commanding officer determines that an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified for promotion, the promotion shall not be effected.  This includes the physical examination requirement per section 10206 of ref (a).  The officer shall be given written notice of the grounds for delay before the effective date of the appointment, unless it is impracticable to do so, in which case the notice shall be given as soon as practicable.  CMC (MMPR-1) must also be notified prior to the effective date of the appointment so that the promotion will not be effected in Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) and administrative action can be initiated.  Refs (a), (b), (c), and (e) contain guidelines for the timely submission of supporting documentation.
10.b.  Adverse Screening Process.  Before the release of this promotion authority, all officers were screened for adverse or potentially adverse information.  The names of those officers with records identified during the adverse screening process as containing adverse or potentially adverse information were removed from the promotion authority MARADMIN.  Those officers will receive correspondence under separate cover from CMC (JPL).
11.  Retirement and Transfer.  Officers considering voluntary retirement should review ref (d) for service obligation prior to acceptance of promotion.  An officer's selection for promotion carries over into the reserve, between AR and SMCR-IRR, and with augmentation into the regular component.
12.  Accepting and Declining Promotion.  Any regular or reserve officer who is promoted under the refs is considered to have accepted such promotion on the effective date contained in paragraphs 3 through 9 (for purposes of date of rank, pay, and allowances in the grade to which promoted).  To decline a promotion, an officer is required to submit a letter of declination to CMC (MMPR-1) expressly at the time their command notifies them of their promotion and directs that they begin wearing the insignia of the next higher grade.  Any statement or action by the officer which signals their acceptance of the promotion, forever waives their right to decline.
13.  The following FY23 promotions are projected for August 2023 and are subject to change.  Promotions from the remaining FY23 boards will be promulgated based on vacancy determination.

GENTEXT/REMARKS/1.  Situation.  Advanced Intermediate Level Schools (A-ILS) produce officers qualified to fill high-impact service and joint planning billets.  These programs enhance an officer’s ability to derive critical insights from large quantities of information; make timely and effective decisions; communicate succinctly verbally, visually, and in writing; and collaborate to design cogent orders and plans.  The curricula of the School of Advanced Warfighting (SAW), School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS), School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS), and the Maritime Advanced Warfighting School (MAWS) feature rigorous case studies, exercises, staff rides, and a consideration of future war.  Marine graduates earn the secondary Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 0505 Operational Planner and an accredited master’s degree.  A-ILS graduates also have a strong record of selection for promotion and command based on their well-developed capability as leaders who reason critically, solve complex problems, and apply operational art.
2.  Mission.  From August to November 2023, A-ILS selection boards will convene to select the best qualified applicants for Academic Year 2024-2025 (AY 24-25) in order to ensure the Marine Corps is supported with highly capable and effective operational planners.

3.B.  Concept of Operations.  This concept of operations is separated into four parts to represent the different Advanced Intermediate Level Education application and selection processes.  Marine officers interested in pursuing a path to the Operational Planner MOS are highly encouraged to apply to multiple schools.  Because each program has its own requirements, applicants should check the respective websites and contact representatives at each school, as required.  Applicants are also encouraged to begin preparations early to better meet the application requirements.

3.B.2.  SAMS
3.B.2.A.  The Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) is a one year graduate-level education program.  AMSP educates and develops effective planners, leaders and teammates who directly assist senior leaders to understand the operational environment and then visualize and describe viable solutions to complex problems.  Graduates of the AMSP are critical and creative thinkers grounded inoperational theory, doctrine, and history; can identify problems and propose viable solutions; can clearly communicate to various audiences orally, graphically, and in writing; are good leaders and great teammates who collaborate effectively to get the job done; have the courage to lead from above, beside, and below; are physically and mentally tough; and are humble professionals who are more than they seem.
3.B.2.B.  The AMSP is for majors and junior lieutenant colonels who have completed their Intermediate Level Education requirement or equivalent.

3.B.3.  SAASS
3.B.3.A.  SAASS is the U.S. Air Force and Space Force graduate school for strategists.  A highly qualified and motivated faculty, a small and carefully selected student body, a coherent and challenging curriculum, outstanding educational and research resources, and a well designed facility combine to produce tomorrow’s senior military leaders who are experts in the role of military force in the art of statecraft.  At the core of the program is a one year in residence Master of Philosophy degree in Military Strategy.  For a select cadre of top graduates, SAASS also offers a Doctorate of Philosophy in Military Strategy.  The emphasis is not on military operations; but, rather on the strategic nexus where military and security professionals interact with decision makers on policy, diplomacy, international relations, geopolitics, and matters of military and political theory.  In short, SAASS takes air, space, and cyber minded officers and educates them to become strategists at the national level where the military tool (airpower in particular) is contemplated as one of several instruments of power that may (or may not) be appropriate for achieving national objectives.
3.B.3.B.  SAASS is tailored for majors and junior lieutenant colonels that have completed Intermediate Level Education.
3.B.3.C.  If interested in applying to the U.S. Air Force SAASS, contact Ms. Sheila McKitt, (comm) (334) 953-5155/DSN 493 or sheila.mckitt@us.af.mil.
3.B.4.  MAWS
3.B.4.A.  MAWS is the U.S. Navy’s resident A-ILE program, completed in conjunction with the College of Naval Command and Staff curriculum.  This course will develop strategic and operational leaders with the skills required to plan, execute, and assess combined, joint, and naval operations.
3.B.4.B.  Applications for the MAWS program are conducted at MAWS for prospective students that are selected and slated to attend the College of Naval Command and Staff in Newport, RI.  U.S. Marine officers interested in attending MAWS are encouraged to list Naval Command and Staff College high on their preference choices for the Commandant’s Professional Intermediate Level Education Board questionnaire.
4.  Administration and Logistics. Follow on assignments.  0505 Operational planners are a low density, high demand MOS in critical billets.  0505 assignments are normally 36 months.  Lieutenant colonels and lieutenant colonel selects with the 0505 MOS will be eligible to screen for command after their first 12 months of their 36 month utilization tour.

3.B.2.  SAMS
3.B.2.A.  The Advanced Military Studies Program (AMSP) is a one year graduate-level education program.  AMSP educates and develops effective planners, leaders and teammates who directly assist senior leaders to understand the operational environment and then visualize and describe viable solutions to complex problems.  Graduates of the AMSP are critical and creative thinkers grounded inoperational theory, doctrine, and history; can identify problems and propose viable solutions; can clearly communicate to various audiences orally, graphically, and in writing; are good leaders and great teammates who collaborate effectively to get the job done; have the courage to lead from above, beside, and below; are physically and mentally tough; and are humble professionals who are more than they seem.
3.B.2.B.  The AMSP is for majors and junior lieutenant colonels who have completed their Intermediate Level Education requirement or equivalent.
3.B.2.C.  If interested in applying to the United States Army AMSP, contact SAMS Administrative Team, (comm) (913) 758-3300/DSN 585 or usarmy.leavenworth.tradoc.mbx.armyu-cgsc-sams-web@army.mil. Find general information on Twitter (@us_sams).
3.B.3.  SAASS
3.B.3.A.  SAASS is the U.S. Air Force and Space Force graduate school for strategists.  A highly qualified and motivated faculty, a small and carefully selected student body, a coherent and challenging curriculum, outstanding educational and research resources, and a well designed facility combine to produce tomorrow’s senior military leaders who are experts in the role of military force in the art of statecraft.  At the core of the program is a one year in residence Master of Philosophy degree in Military Strategy.  For a select cadre of top graduates, SAASS also offers a Doctorate of Philosophy in Military Strategy.  The emphasis is not on military operations; but, rather on the strategic nexus where military and security professionals interact with decision makers on policy, diplomacy, international relations, geopolitics, and matters of military and political theory.  In short, SAASS takes air, space, and cyber minded officers and educates them to become strategists at the national level where the military tool (airpower in particular) is contemplated as one of several instruments of power that may (or may not) be appropriate for achieving national objectives.
3.B.3.B.  SAASS is tailored for majors and junior lieutenant colonels that have completed Intermediate Level Education.
3.B.3.C.  If interested in applying to the U.S. Air Force SAASS, contact Ms. Sheila McKitt, (comm) (334) 953-5155/DSN 493 or sheila.mckitt@us.af.mil.
3.B.4.  MAWS
3.B.4.A.  MAWS is the U.S. Navy’s resident A-ILE program, completed in conjunction with the College of Naval Command and Staff curriculum.  This course will develop strategic and operational leaders with the skills required to plan, execute, and assess combined, joint, and naval operations.
3.B.4.B.  Applications for the MAWS program are conducted at MAWS for prospective students that are selected and slated to attend the College of Naval Command and Staff in Newport, RI.  U.S. Marine officers interested in attending MAWS are encouraged to list Naval Command and Staff College high on their preference choices for the Commandant’s Professional Intermediate Level Education Board questionnaire.
4.  Administration and Logistics. Follow on assignments.  0505 Operational planners are a low density, high demand MOS in critical billets.  0505 assignments are normally 36 months.  Lieutenant colonels and lieutenant colonel selects with the 0505 MOS will be eligible to screen for command after their first 12 months of their 36 month utilization tour.

NARR/REF A IS MARADMIN 408/19 ENLISTED ACTIVE-DUTY SERVICE LIMITS AND HIGH YEAR TENURE. REF B IS MCO 1040.31, THE ENLISTED RETENTION AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT MANUAL. REF C IS MCO 1900.16 W/CH 1, MARINE CORPS SEPARATION AND RETIREMENT MANUAL. REF D IS MCO P1400.32D W/CH 2, THE ENLISTED PROMOTIONS MANUAL. REF E IS MARINE CORPS RECRUITING COMMAND ORDER 1100.1A. REF F IS MCBUL 1300 SERGEANTS MAJOR SLATING PROCESS.//
GENTEXT/REMARKS/1. The modern battlefield is characterized by all-domain, distributed operations. The Marine Corps must retain sufficient proven, experienced, highly qualified Marines with critical warfighting skills to succeed in this technology-saturated environment.
2. Background.
2.a. The purpose of the Marine Corps’ Enlisted Career Force Controls (ECFC) program, which establishes service limits for each grade, is to support the desired by-grade distribution of Marines across the Service.
2.b. The growth of many Force Design-2030 technical skillsets, along with recent retention and promotion behavior, demands increased flexibility in the traditional “up-or-out” policy.  Such refinements will improve Marine Corps warfighting capability by enabling the retention of more qualified, experienced Marines in high-demand occupational fields when required to enhance readiness.
2.c. Service limits, as outlined below, represent the maximum time a Marine can serve in a particular grade without a waiver.  These below service limits do not guarantee continued service; rather eligibility for continued service remains based on Marine Corps warfighting requirements, individual performance, and personal conduct. These criteria are the primary determinates of HQMC’s reenlistment adjudication decisions.
3.  Updated Policy.
3.a. Effective 1 July 2023, HQMC is authorized to approve reenlistments and extensions of Marines who were eligible but not promoted to the next grade two or more times in accordance with the below policy. Exceptions to this policy may be requested via waiver as outlined below.
3.b.  Service limits require that Marines who have reached a certain year of service in their current grade be either separated from the active component at their expiration of active service (EAS) or transferred to the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve (FMCR).
3.b.1. Service limits are as follows:
Cpl: 8 years active Marine Corps service
Sgt: 12 years active Marine Corps service
SSgt: 20 years active military service
GySgt: 22 years active military service 
1stSgt/MSgt: 27 years active military service 
SgtMaj/MGySgt: 30 years active military service
3.b.2. Marines on their first enlistment may be granted up to a 6-year reenlistment without regards to service limits.
3.c. Maximum age limit.  Effective 1 July 2023, the maximum age limit for enlisted Marines’ service is hereby 58 years old.  This change adheres to the Marine Corps Recruiting Command's 28-year-old enlistment age guideline, allowing these Marines to serve a complete 30-year career subject to the demands of warfighting, individual performance, and personal conduct.
3.d.  Retention Waivers.
3.d.1.  Corporals may be granted a waiver for active Marine Corps service up to 10 years if favorably endorsed at the O-6 level and approved by CMC (MMEA).
3.d.2.  Sergeants may be granted a waiver for active Marine Corps service up to 14 years if favorably endorsed at the O-6 level and approved by CMC (MMEA).
3.d.3. In extraordinary circumstances, when clearly in the interest of the Marine Corps due to critical skills considerations, E6-E8 waivers to the above service limitations may be approved by CMC (MMEA). Waivers for E6-E8 will be endorsed by the Marine’s first general officer in the chain of command.
3.d.4.  Exceptions to policy for existing E9 slating processes will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  If selected, continued service will be automatically authorized via slating message.
3.d.5. Marines who have received BRS continuation pay will be allowed to fulfill all remaining service obligation related to their acceptance of continuation pay.
3.e.  Transfer to the FMCR. The FMCR consists of enlisted personnel who have completed 20, but less than 30, years of active service and are receiving retainer pay.
3.e.1.  Marines eligible for retirement who have reached service limits must transfer to the FMCR per ref C. Marines must request retirement between 6-18 months of their planned retirement/resignation (PRR) date after satisfying incurred service obligations.
3.e.2.  Marines, who meet eligibility requirements to transfer to the FMCR, and are requesting a waiver of service limits will submit an AA Form/standard naval letter with justification, via the Marine's chain of command to CMC (MMSR-2) for processing.  Justifications include but are not limited to specific or mission requirements.  Service limit waivers will not be considered for service limit extensions greater than one year.
3.f. Marines who are currently approved for retirement based on previous high-year tenure guidance, but now wish to continue service can request to change their retirement date.  If the change request is 18-months or more, Marines are to submit a reenlistment or extension request IAW reference B; if the change is for less than 18 months, request a modification IAW reference C. In all cases, the endorsement authority is the O5 commander.
3.g. Command teams are encouraged to identify seasoned, experienced Marines with high-demand skills and encourage their reenlistment in accordance with this policy.
4.  Reserve applicability.  This MARADMIN is not applicable to the Marine Corps Reserve.
5.  Release authorized by LtGen James F. Glynn, Deputy Commandant, Manpower & Reserve Affairs.//

Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act









DoD
        Directive 1440.1, DoD Civilian Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Program - At sub-section 5.2.7, of
    this document (page 6) the Secretary of Defense assigns to the Heads of DoD Components the responsibility to
    ""ensure fair, impartial, and timely investigation and resolution of complaints of discrimination in employment,
    including complaints of sexual harassment"" by implementing the procedures outlined in sub-section 6.2.4 (page
    8). Each DoD Component, therefore, has its own discrimination complaint program and process, to include the issuance
    of final agency decisions and the payment of judgements, when appropriate.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)














If you would like to submit a request, please do so electronically using FOIAonline www.foiaonline.gov.  Select the Department of the Navy-including Marine Corps then United States Marine Corps from the dropdown and from the third dropdown select the command to which you wish to submit your request (i.e., the command that would maintain the records you are seeking).
If you submitted a request through the U.S. Postal Service or via facsimile and have not received an acknowledgement, this means that we have not received it.  Please re-submit your request following the process above.

Each federal agency is responsible for meeting its FOIA responsibilities for its own records.  This site is designed to familiarize you with the specific procedures for making a request for records controlled by the U.S. Marine Corps
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 United States Code (USC) 552, allows an individual (regardless of nationality), a private organization or company, or a local, state, or foreign government to seek access to Executive Branch agency RECORDS, such as those held by the U.S. Marine Corps.
All agencies of the U.S. Government are required to disclose records upon receiving a written request, except those records that are protected from disclosure pursuant to nine exemptions and three exclusions.  The FOIA applies only to federal agencies and does not create a right of access to records held by Congress, the courts, or by state or local government agencies.  Any requests for state or local government records should be directed to the appropriate state or local government agency. 
As a component of the Department of the Navy, Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.42G, Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program (SECNAVINST 5720.42G), governs the Marine Corps FOIA program.  SECNAVINST 5720.42G is codified at 32 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 701.
If you require assistance with submitting a request or if you have questions regarding the status of a request, you may contact the Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps (HQMC), FOIA Requester Service Center.

You may also contact MCIEAST FOIA office directly at foia.mcieast@usmc.mil.
*DO NOT INCLUDE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN YOUR REQUEST* (If needed, you will be contacted by the FOIA Service Center processing your request.) If you are submitting a FOIA request from a U.S. Government computer, DO NOT select any CAC certificates when prompted.  Click on 'cancel'.

                    ...


Reunions with your fellow Marines are important. Unlike those boring high school reunions where you struggle to find anything to talk about with a bunch of people who just can’t relate to who you are, reunions with fellow Marines are a true reuniting with friends and comrades who have done what you have done, been where you have been, and truly understand you. Marine reunions strengthen ties with your fellow Marines and provide a place where you can talk about your experience with people who understand. They reconnect you with a meaningful time in your life and with the group of people who shared that time. Are you ready to attend a reunion?

    MARADMIN Malfunction


The app is pretty good but the search ability for MARADMIN doesn’t work. Searching for keywords or even the MARADMIN number brings up a loading screen that never actually loads.

    Not very useful and not current


The App is not kept up to date with current policy. Calculators are outdated, links dont work, and searches fail. It is a good idea if the App was actually managed to maintain relevancy. Marines are better off just getting information through traditional means.

    Crashes


App is more centered around media updates than functional / informative applications like MarAdmin access, rank structures, USMC history, USMC knowledge, etc...It had some, but you have to dig in the submenu for it, when social media / news dominates the home screen. Also, the PFT/CFT app crashed every time I tried to use it. iCorps app is way more functional and less media based.
